<h2 class='nobreak' id='chI'>CHAPTER I&mdash;THE FRIENDLY GRIP</h2>


<p>“And yonder’s a snap-dragon; and that’s a
buttercup. That is feverfew growing over there;
and there’s foxglove right there in that swampy
place. Those are cowslip blossoms&mdash;the English
cowslip is different from ours.”</p>

<p>“Whew!” blew Phil Morgan, unpuckering his
lips and breaking off the haunting little air he had
been whistling. “I wouldn’t believe you knew
so much about the <i>flora</i> of this strange land,
Frenchy.”</p>

<p>“Oi, oi! Is it Flora he’s bragging about? Then
Frenchy’s got a new girl!”</p>

<p>“Sounds to me,” mumbled Al Torrance, who
lay along the flower-bestrewed bank with his hat
over his eyes, “that he was discussing the fauna
of the country&mdash;with his snap-dragons, and fox’s
gloves, and cows slipping.”</p>

<p>“Ignoramus that you are!” scoffed Michael
Donahue, otherwise “Frenchy.” “I am talkin’ to
Whistler. <i>He</i> knows something and appreciates
the profundity of me learnin’.”</p>

<p>“Ye-as,” drawled Torrance, otherwise “Torry,”
as their leader began droning away, his lips
puckered again. “He knows just enough to whistle the
same awful tune for an hour. What is it, anyway,
Phil?”</p>

<p>“The tune the old cow died on, I guess,” suggested
Ikey Rosenmeyer.</p>

<p>“It’s a tune Phoebe was playing on the piano
a good deal the last time we were home,” said
Whistler with some gravity. “Wish I’d hear
from the folks again. I am worried about
Phoebe.”</p>

<p>He spoke of his eldest sister, who during the
last few months had not been well. Although, like
many brothers and sisters, Philip Morgan, by his
chums usually called Whistler, and Phoebe had
their differences, now when far from home, “the
folks” seem nearer and dearer than ever in his
mind.</p>

<p>Philip Morgan lay with his chums on a bank
beside a tiny trickle of water called a brook in
that shire, although it was nothing more than a
rill. They were high up on “the downs,” overlooking
a port in which the American destroyer
<i>Colodia</i> lay at anchor amid a multitude of naval
vessels of three nations.</p>

<p>Over the sea a thick haze, on land the yellow
sunshine, so welcome when it is seen in England
that it seems more beautiful than elsewhere. The
boys had forty-three hours’ shore leave, and for
that brief space of time they desired, as most
sailors do, to get just as far away in spirit and in
surroundings from the ship as possible.</p>

<p>They had tramped into the country the day before,
spent the night in four wonderful beds in an
old inn that might have harbored some of Sir
Francis Drake’s men at the time of the Armada,
and were now due at the wharf in a few hours.</p>

<p>Life aboard a destroyer or an American submarine
chaser in foreign service is not very
pleasant if it is exciting. The space for sleeping,
for instance, on these fast vessels is scarcely
greater than that assigned to the crews of submarines.
As Ikey Rosenmeyer, who possessed a
riotous imagination, had said at the inn:</p>

<p>“Oi, oi! sleeping in a real bed again is better
than bein’ at home in Ireland, and Frenchy says
that’s heaven ’cause his mother came from there.
Why, it is better’n heaven! You could spread out
your legs and wiggle all your toes without havin’
the master-at-arms down on you like a thousand
of brick.”</p>

<p>Frenchy, in a dreamy and poetic mood, not infrequent
when the romantic Irish blood in his
veins was stirred, was gazing off over the sea at
the fogbank.</p>

<p>“Think of it,” he murmured, “How many
hundred an’ thousan’ of ships have sailed out of
this harbor into just such a fogbank as that&mdash;”</p>

<p>“And never came back,” interrupted Torry.
“Some tough old gobs, the ancient British seamen,
boy.”</p>

<p>“‘Tough’ is right,” chuckled Frenchy, his
poetic feelings exploded. “And they haven’t got
over it yet. They’ve got old-timers in the British
Navy now that can remember when the cat was
used on the men’s backs, reg’lar.”</p>

<p>“And every British sailor had tar on his
breeches&mdash;that’s why they used to call ’em ‘brave
British tars,’” scoffed Torry. “Can it! These
English chaps are all right. They aren’t much
different from us garbies.”</p>

<p>“Is <i>that</i> so?” exclaimed Ikey, whose sharp
eyes allowed little to escape them. “What kind of
a deep-sea crab do you call this comin’ down the
road right now, I want to know?”</p>

<p>Phil Morgan paid no attention to what his
mates were talking about. The peaceful English
landscape charmed his eye.</p>

<p>Down the gently sloping road which, after a
mile or so, led into the Upper Town, as it was
called in distinction from the port, or Lower
Town, the stone cottages&mdash;some almost hidden by
vines&mdash;stood sentinel-wise along the way.</p>

<p>One rather larger house was a schoolhouse.
Nothing at all like the schoolhouses in America
in appearance. But Phil Morgan knew it was a
schoolhouse, and that the school was in session,
for he had seen the children filing in not long
before and their voices had been raised in song
just before Frenchy had begun to note the different
flowers.</p>

<p>The excited chatter of the other boys finally
aroused Morgan from his contemplation of the
peaceful scene. In the other direction, toward
which his mates were looking, the outlook was
not so peaceful. At least, not at one particular
spot in the hedge-bordered road. It did not need
a sailor’s weather eye to see that the situation was
“squally.”</p>

<p>The “deep-sea crab,” the presence of which
Ikey had announced, proved on further examination
to be two individuals, not one. But they
were closely attached to one another and the way
they “wee-wawed,” as Torry said, from one side
of the road to the other, certainly would lead to
the supposition that intoxication was the cause of
such tacking from hedge to hedge.</p>

<p>“And one of ’em’s one of our own garbies,”
declared Frenchy. “Isn’t that a shame?”</p>

<p>“But look at that big feller, will you?” gasped
Ikey. “Why, he must weigh a ton!”</p>

<p>“You’re stretching that a bit, Ikey,” admonished
Whistler, breaking off in his tune to
speak. “But he is a whale of a man.”</p>

<p>“Biggest garby I ever saw,” breathed Torry,
amazed.</p>

<p>It was the big fellow only, it proved, who was
partly intoxicated. He was a British sailor. His
companion was both perfectly sober and perfectly
mad. His face was aflame as he and his unwelcome
companion approached the four Navy
Boys.</p>

<p>The big fellow gripped him by the collar of his
blouse, and it was utterly impossible for the Yankee
lad to get away from “the friendly grip.”</p>

<p>“Talk about this ‘hands across the sea’ stuff,”
murmured Torrance. “Here’s a case where it is
going too far. We’ll have to rescue a brother
garby, won’t we?”</p>

<p>“Believe me, that’s a reg’lar mamma’s boy
Johnny Bull has got his grip on, too,” chuckled
Frenchy.</p>

<p>“Hush up, you fellows,” advised Phil Morgan,
with sudden interest. “I believe I know that fellow.”</p>

<p>“Not Goliath yonder?” cried Ikey Rosenmeyer.
“I didn’t know you sailed with such
craft.”</p>

<p>“The other chap,” Morgan explained.</p>

<p>“If he’s a friend,” began Torrance, commencing
to roll back his sleeves suggestively.</p>

<p>“Sit down!” advised the older boy, sharply.
“We’d look nice piling onto that big fellow,
wouldn’t we?”</p>

<p>“And the whole of us couldn’t handle him,”
murmured Frenchy.</p>

<p>“You never know till you try,” said the optimistic
Torrance.</p>

<p>“This is a case for strategy,” stated Morgan.
“Now, don’t any of you fellows lose your heads.”
Then he hailed the two tacking along the road:</p>

<p>“Ahoy! Hey, you!”</p>

<p>The American lad who was held in durance by
the British sailor looked up and showed something
besides the red flag of annoyance in his
countenance.</p>

<p>“I say, you fellows!” he cried. “Help me out
of this, will you?”</p>

<p>At this the huge British seaman for the first
time appeared to see the four boys on the bank
beside the road.</p>

<p>“My heye!” he bellowed, standing still, but
wagging his head from side to side in a perfectly
ridiculous way. “My heye! ’Ere’s a ’ole bloomin’
ship load of ’em. Ahoy, me ’earties, let the heagle
scream!” and he led off in a mighty cheer that
awoke the echoes of the heretofore peaceful countryside.</p>

<p>Frenchy and Ikey, in great glee, sprang up and
cheered with him. But the expression in the
countenance of the giant’s captive caused the two
older Navy Boys to smother their amusement.</p>

<p>“That’s the way he’s been going on for four
hours&mdash;and more,” groaned the captive. “Why!
he hung on to my collar all the time we were
eating dinner up there at that inn. Made the barmaid
cut up his victuals for him. Paid her a
shilling for doing it.”</p>

<p>“Say, is her name Flora?” Ikey asked, at once
interested. “Is that the girl Frenchy was just
talking about?”</p>

<p>But Torrance quenched him with a hand on his
mouth. The situation of the Yankee youth in that
giant’s hands seemed more serious than they
supposed. The grip of the big hand never relaxed.</p>

<p>“’Ere we are, all together, me ’earties,” rumbled
the giant. “Hi’m glad to know yuh. Hi’m
Willum Johnson, ’im that ’ad a barrow hin the
Old Kent Road before the war. Hand jolly well
knowed Hi was to the perlice,” confessed the
man frankly.</p>

<p>“Hit allus took six bobbies to take me hin,
lads. Hand now <i>one</i> o’ the bloomin’ hofficers
makes me walk a chalkline, haboard ship. Hi tell
yuh, ain’t this war terrible?”</p>

<p>“That’s what it is,” admitted Frenchy, staring
at the man with wide-open eyes.</p>

<p>“Come over here and sit down&mdash;and tell us all
about it,” Whistler Morgan said, beckoning.</p>

<p>“Hi’ll go yuh!” declared the giant seaman.
“Hand so wull me friend&mdash;one o’ the nicest little
Yankees Hi ever come across.”</p>

<p>The strange Yankee sailor was too much
disturbed by his situation to look very closely at
Phil and his comrades. The viselike grip of the
semi-intoxicated giant on his collar was the principal
thing in the victim’s mind.</p>

<p>Almost as soon as the British seaman sprawled
on the grassy bank his head began to nod and his
eyes to close.</p>

<p>“He’s going off,” whispered Al Torrance.</p>

<p>“You’d think he would,” returned the victim
of the over-friendly seaman, in the same tone, “if
you could have seen him eat and drink. You
never saw such an appetite! He had everybody
at that inn standing around and gaping at us.”</p>

<p>It was evident that the young sailor felt his
position deeply. He was a nice looking fellow,
very neat in his dress, and with delicate features.</p>

<p>“How did you come to fall in with him in the
first place?” Al asked, as the giant began to snore.</p>

<p>“Why,” explained the stranger, “I started to
walk down to the port because it was so pleasant.
He was sitting outside the place where I stopped
for tea and muffins after I’d walked a way. I
had no idea he was so&mdash;so far gone. But he must
have been drinking for days,” casting a disgusted
glance at his close companion whose hamlike
hand never relaxed. “He learned where I
was going, and he at once got a grip on my collar.
He hasn’t let go since&mdash;I never saw such a
man!” concluded the stranger morosely.</p>

<p>“His hand will drop off when he gets sound
asleep,” Whistler said comfortingly. “Then we’ll
sneak.”</p>

<p>“Don’t you believe it!” whispered the other in
vast disgust. “He fell asleep after dinner, but his
fingers are just clamped on to my collar. When I
tried to wriggle away, he awoke. See!”</p>

<p>He tried to pull away from the friendly grip.
At once the British seaman half aroused; but his
fingers never relaxed.</p>

<blockquote>
“William Johnson his my nyme&mdash;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Seaman’s my hav-o-cation!<br>
Hi’m hin this war for a penny-bun&mdash;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Hand so is hall my nation!
</blockquote>
<p style='text-indent:0'>Hoo-roo!” mumbled the gigantic sailor, and fell
asleep again.</p>

<p>“Now, what do you know about that?” demanded
the victim of brotherly love. “And me&mdash;Well,
I’m due aboard the <i>Colodia</i> to-day.”</p>

<p>“The <i>Colodia</i>!” exclaimed the four Navy Boys
in chorus.</p>

<p>None of them wore a designating mark, for
they had on their white service caps. But the
<i>Colodia</i> was the Yankee destroyer to which Morgan,
Torrance, Donahue and Rosenmeyer belonged.
The four gazed on the stranger with increased
interest at his statement.</p>

<p>“Say,” Whistler asked, “aren’t you George Belding?
Didn’t you and your folks come up to
Seacove from New York five or six years ago and
spend the summer in the old Habershaw House?
I’m Phil Morgan. We lived right next to the
Habershaw House.”</p>

<p>“My goodness!” exclaimed the strange youth,
sticking out his hand to grab Whistler’s. “And
your father, Dr. Morgan, and mine went to college
together. That’s what brought us up to
Seacove. Sure! My mother wasn’t well. We
all got fat and sassy up there. I declare I’m glad
to see you, Phil Morgan!”</p>

<p>“Me long lost brother!” whispered Frenchy to
the others. “Have you still got the strawberry
mark upon your arm?”</p>

<p>But Al Torrance was quite as serious as Whistler
and the newly-introduced George Belding.</p>

<p>“Say, fellows,” Al said, “if he’s going to be one
of us on the old destroyer, we’ve got to help him
out of this mess.”</p>

<p>“Go ahead! How?” demanded Ikey.</p>

<p>Al produced a pocketknife which he opened
quickly. It had a long and sharp blade. He approached
the snoring giant on the bank.</p>

<p>“Oi Oi!” gasped Ikey Rosenmeyer. “Never
mind! Don’t kill him in cold blood. Remember,
Torry, it’s Germans we’re fightin’, not these
Britishers.”</p>

<p>“What are you going to do?” demanded Belding.</p>

<p>“Cut your collar away,” said Torrance.
“That’s about all you can do. If he wants to
hang on to the collar, let him.”</p>

<p>“It’ll spoil his shirt,” objected Ikey.</p>

<p>“Sh! Go ahead,” murmured Belding. “It’s a
good idea. I couldn’t get at my own knife and
do it, with him hanging on to me so tightly.”</p>

<p>“Take care, Al,” advised Whistler. “And you
other fellows stand aside. Be ready to run when
George is free.”</p>

<p>His advice was good. The giant seaman still
snored, but it would not take much to rouse him.</p>

<p>The five boys were now so much interested in
the attempt to get Belding free that they took no
heed of anything else. So they were all shocked
when a chorus of steam whistles and sirens suddenly
broke forth from the port below them. A
gun boomed on the admiral’s ship. Pandemonium
was let loose without warning.</p>

<p>“Oh, my aunt!” groaned George Belding,
“what is <i>that</i>?”</p>

<p>“Willum Johnson” awoke with a start and a
grunt, and, sitting up on the bank, demanded of
everybody in general, “’Oo’s shootin’ hof the
bloomin’ gun?”</p>

<p>But Whistler and Torry had whirled to look
out to sea. They had heard a similar alarm before.
Out of the blue-gray fogbank over the sea,
and high, high up toward the hazy sky, whirled a
black object, no bigger at first than a bird. But
how rapidly it approached the port, and how
quickly its outline became perfectly clear!</p>

<p>“A Zep, boys!” cried Al Torrance. “There’s
a raid on! That’s a German machine, sure’s
you are a foot high!”</p>

<p>“Are you sure?” murmured Belding, who had
been dragged quickly to his feet by the giant.</p>

<p>“Hit’s the bloomin’ ’Uns&mdash;no fear it ain’t!”
ejaculated the big British seaman. “Ah! There
goes the a-he-rial guns.”</p>

<p>Splotches of white smoke sprang up from
several shoulders of the hill that overlooked the
port. The watchful coast-defense men were not
unprepared; but the enemy airship, rapidly growing
bigger in the boys’ eyes, winged its way nearer
to the land, boldly ignoring the shells sent up to
meet it.</p>

<p>“She’s going to drop her bombs right over the
town!” gasped Whistler, grabbing Belding, who
was nearest.</p>


<h2 id='chII'>CHAPTER II&mdash;THE HUN IN HIS FURY</h2>


<p>Wheeling up from behind them on the higher
shoulder of the hill, an airplane spiraled into the
upper ether, in an attempt to get above the huge
machine that had, two minutes before, appeared
out of the sea fog. But this attempt to balk the
Hun, like those of the anti-aircraft guns in their
emplacements about the port, promised little success.</p>

<p>The fog had made the close approach of the
huge Zeppelin possible, and now the rumble of the
motors of the enemy machine could be heard
clearly by the four Navy Boys on the hillside and
their two companions.</p>

<p>“Oh, cracky!” gasped Al Torrance. “She’s
coming!”</p>

<p>“And right this way!” gulped Ikey Rosenmeyer.
“If she drops a bomb&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Good-night!” completed Frenchy in a
sepulchral tone.</p>

<p>“Let’s get under cover!” cried George Belding,
striving again to get away from the “friendly
grip” of the British sailor, Willum Johnson.</p>

<p>“Hold on!” commanded Whistler Morgan.
“No use losing our heads over this.”</p>

<p>“If one of those bombs lands near us we’ll likely
lose more than our heads,” grumbled Torry.</p>

<p>“Wait! If we run like a bunch of scared rabbits,
we are likely to run right into danger rather
than away from it.”</p>

<p>“Those horns down there say ‘Find a cellar!’”
whispered Frenchy.</p>

<p>“Oi, oi!” added Ikey. “There ain’t no cellars
up here on this hill yet.”</p>

<p>“Keep cool,” repeated Whistler. The other
boys were used to listening to him, and to following
his advice. He was a cautious as well as a
courageous lad, and his chums were usually safe
in following Philip Morgan’s lead.</p>

<p>These four boys, all hailing from the New
England coast town of Seacove, had begun their
first “hitch,” as an enlistment is called, in the
United States Navy as apprentice seamen, several
months before America got into the Great War,
and some months before the oldest of the four
was eighteen.</p>

<p>They had now spent more than a year and a
half in the service, and their experiences had been
many and varied. After their initial training at
Saugarack, the big Naval training camp, the four
chums, with others of their friends and camp
associates, had been sent aboard the torpedo boat
destroyer, <i>Colodia</i>, one of the newest, largest, and
fastest of her type in the United States Navy.</p>

<p>The <i>Colodia’s</i> first two cruises were full of
excitement and adventure for the four Navy
Boys, especially for Philip Morgan; for he fell
overboard from the destroyer and was picked up
by the German submarine U-812, and his experiences
thereon and escape therefrom, are narrated
in the first volume of this series, entitled: “Navy
Boys After the Submarines; Or, Protecting the
Giant Convoy.”</p>

<p>The second of the series, “Navy Boys Chasing
a Sea Raider; or Landing a Million Dollar Prize,”
relates the experiences of these four friends on a
longer and even more adventurous cruise of the
<i>Colodia</i>. Under the command of Ensign MacMasters,
the Navy Boys as members of a prize
crew, took the captured <i>Graf von Posen</i> into
Norfolk; and their experiences on the captured
raider made a dramatic and exciting story of the
day-by-day work of the boys of the Navy.</p>

<p>Through their kind friend Mr. Alonzo Minnette,
who was holding a volunteer position at
Washington in the Navy Department, the four
chums obtained a chance to cruise with the superdreadnaught
<i>Kennebunk</i>, a brand new and one
of the largest of the modern American fighting
machines launched during the first months of the
war. The <i>Colodia</i> having gone across the Atlantic
while the boys were with the captured raider, they
with Ensign MacMasters were very glad to join
the crew of the huge superdreadnaught in the
interim.</p>

<p>The third volume of the series, “Navy Boys
Behind the Big Guns; Or, Sinking the German
U-Boats,” took our heroes into perils and adventures
which they will long remember, for they
included work in the gun turrets of the <i>Kennebunk</i>,
a wreck that threatened the lives of all four
chums, a mix-up with German spies, and finally a
record trip across the Atlantic by which the huge
superdreadnaught arrived at the rendezvous in
time to take part in a naval engagement which
put a part of the Hun navy to flight.</p>

<p>Now the four friends were back on the <i>Colodia</i>
which was doing patrol duty off the English
and French coasts, and convoying troop and food
ships through the submarine and mine zones. The
base of the squadron of which the destroyer was
a member was at this English port, on the hillside
above which Philip Morgan, Alfred Torrance,
Michael Donahue and Ikey Rosenmeyer have
been introduced just as they met the American
sailor lad, George Belding, and his doubtful
friend, the giant ex-coster, “Willum” Johnson.</p>

<p>“Keep cool,” Whistler urged again, as the Zeppelin
sailed inland. “There is no use running&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>His further speech was smothered by a terrific
explosion from the port below. A lurid burst of
flame, stronger than the sunlight, shot into the air
where a wharf and warehouse had been. Smoke
followed, instantly hiding the mark the bomb
from the Zeppelin had found.</p>

<p>This daylight raid was the boldest the Germans
had attempted. The enemy must have supposed
the fog was over the land as well as the sea, or he
would never have risked the attack.</p>

<p>Again a nerve-racking explosion following a
flash of light that seared their eyeballs, and the
middle of the town&mdash;the market place&mdash;was
shrouded by thick smoke.</p>

<p>“The dirty ’ounds!” bawled the British seaman,
suddenly finding his voice. “The dirty
’ounds! They’re killin’ women an’ kids down
there! Lemme get my bloomin’ ’ands on ’em!”</p>

<p>He dropped George Belding’s collar at last and
would have started in a clumsy run down the
hill. It was Whistler who stopped him, with a
two-handed grip on the Englishman’s collar now.</p>

<p>“What good would you be down there, man?”
the American youth demanded. “You’d only get
yours, too, maybe. Those bombs are falling two
or three thousand feet.”</p>

<p>“Argh!” growled Willum Johnson, shaking
his huge fists in the air, his face raised to the
coming Zeppelin. The growl was animal-like,
not human. “Argh! Lemme get ’em&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>A third bomb exploded. A big house below
them, half way down the hillside, disappeared.
It was as though a monstrous sponge had been
wiped across that spot and erased the building!</p>

<p>“Oh! Look out! Look out!” sobbed Frenchy,
and covered his eyes with his hands.</p>

<p>His chum Ikey shook beside him, but could not
close his eyes to the horror.</p>

<p>The Zeppelin was curving around, evidently
determined to make for the sea and the fogbank
again. Beneath it, on either side, even above it,
the bursts of white smoke betrayed the explosion
of aerial shells the defense guns were firing at the
enemy machine. And all the time the single
British airplane on duty was climbing skyward.</p>

<p>“If that thing can only get above the Zep.!”
murmured Al Torrance.</p>

<p>Suddenly the airplane darted toward the sea, in
a sharp slant upward. Bravely the pilot sought
to cut off the Zeppelin’s escape into the fogbank
out of which she had burst five minutes before.</p>

<p>Guns from the Huns’ airship began to bark.
They were firing on the British plane. The latter’s
guns made no reply as she continued to
mount into the upper air.</p>

<p>The course of the Hun machine was changed
again. In approaching the hills surrounding the
port the Zeppelin was brought much nearer to the
earth.</p>

<p>The ship was indeed a monster! Swung
landward to escape the mounting airplane, the Zeppelin,
its motors thundering, came closer and closer
to the spot where the American sailor boys were
standing.</p>

<p>“Bli’me!” roared the apparently fast-sobering
Britisher. “They are goin’ to drop one o’ them
blarsted buns on our bloomin’ ’eads!”</p>

<p>“‘Buns’ is good,” groaned Al. “<i>Here she
comes!</i>”</p>

<p>It seemed as though the great airship was
directly above them. The boys actually saw the
bomb released and fall!</p>

<p>There was no possible mistake on the part of
the brutal crew and commander of the Zeppelin.
They knew very well the bomb would fall upon
no warship in the harbor, or any possible storage
place of munitions. Up here on the hillside were
nothing but little dwellings and&mdash;the schoolhouse!</p>

<p>As though it were aimed at that house of instruction,
the great shell fell and burst! If
teacher and pupils had descended into the cellar
at the first alarm of the horns and guns, it would
scarcely have availed to save them. The shot was
too direct.</p>

<p>One moment the green-tiled, freshly whitened
walls of the schoolhouse stood out plainly against
the yellow and green landscape. Then, with a
roar, it was wiped out and a huge balloon of
whitish brown smoke took its place.</p>

<p>The explosion shook the air and the earth. The
group of Navy Boys were struck to the ground.
Only the gigantic figure of Willum Johnson remained
erect, and he wavering on his feet and
mouthing threats at the enemy.</p>

<p>“They killed ’em! They killed ’em!” he bawled,
when he could be heard. “The women an’ the
kids!”</p>

<p>He started on a staggering run, up the road this
time, as though trying to follow the wake of the
fast descending Zeppelin. The British airplane
was above the enemy machine and was raking it
with machine gun fire. Some damage had been
suffered by the Zeppelin. She was descending,
out of control.</p>

<p>But Morgan ran down the hill, toward the
bombed schoolhouse&mdash;or the place where it had
been. The other boys followed him. Frenchy
was frankly crying, and Ikey clung to his hand as
though afraid to let go.</p>


<h2 id='chIII'>CHAPTER III&mdash;THE MISSING MAN</h2>


<p>The smoking ruins of the schoolhouse and its
outbuildings were now visible. The five boys
came to the edge of the crater which marked the
effect of the explosion of the bomb from the Zeppelin.</p>

<p>From somewhere appeared an old man in a
smock, and his hard, weather-beaten face writhed
with an emotion unspeakable. His outstretched
shaking hand pointed to the spot where the schoolhouse
had stood.</p>

<p>“I saw her face at the pane but the moment
before. She waved her hand to me,” he said.</p>

<p>His awestricken tone made the American lads
tremble. A younger man with his face bloody
from a wound above the temple appeared beside
the boys with the same startling suddenness.</p>

<p>“’Twas his gran’darter. She teached here,”
whispered the wounded man. He laid hold upon
the old man. “Come away, Daddie,” he said.
“Come away wi’ me now.”</p>

<p>A woman screamed up the road just as Phil
Morgan spied a motor ambulance with a huge
red cross on it, mounting from the port. Rescue
parties were afoot already. There really was
nothing the American lads could do at the
wrecked schoolhouse. The shrill cry of the
woman above them caused all five to turn to look.</p>

<p>“’Tis down! ’Tis down!”</p>

<p>The Americans were just in season to see the
Zeppelin crumble like a huge concertina and dive
toward the earth. Fire broke out amidships.</p>

<p>The landing of the Hun airship took place far
up on the open hill, in a pasture above the road.
The boys could see the gigantic British seaman
toiling toward the Zeppelin. He was the nearest
person to the burning airship as it came down,
although there were other men running over the
downs toward the spot.</p>

<p>“Cracky!” exclaimed Al Torrance to Belding,
“your big chum is going to fight them single
handed!”</p>

<p>“Come on, fellows!” Whistler cried, starting
away. “We can do no good here. But those
Germans must not escape!”</p>

<p>“No chance!” exclaimed Ikey. “They won’t
even try. If the English hung every member of
the Zep crews they caught the Kaiser would soon
have hard work finding men to man the bomb-droppers.”</p>

<p>“Right you are,” Frenchy agreed. “The baby-killers!”</p>

<p>He was still sobbing. Right then and there the
Navy Boys would have been glad to take vengeance
on the crew of the Zeppelin. The first
man was descending out of the burning machine.
The Americans saw the huge British sailor spring
upon him.</p>

<p>“There was no <i>kamerad</i> stuff,” Torry observed.
The two locked and went to the ground, disappearing
in a wallow.</p>

<p>At this sight the boys uttered a cheer and leaped
the hedge beside the road. They tore up the hill
as fast as they could run. A shot sounded, and
the spurt of flame and smoke marked the appearance
of a farmer with a shotgun. He, however,
was firing at the balloon of the Zeppelin, not at
her crew.</p>

<p>From the machine a second figure dropped to
the ground, and just as the farmer fired his second
barrel. This second member of the crew darted
away from the burning wreck and disappeared
into the furze that covered the summit of the hill.</p>

<p>“That Heinie’s running away, Whistler!” cried
Al, but kept on himself with the younger boys
toward the airship.</p>

<p>Belding looked at Whistler. “Shall we let him
beat it?” the former asked the Seacove boy.</p>

<p>“Not on your life!” Whistler cried. “Come
on! If we’re not a match for one Heinie&mdash;we
two&mdash;then&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>They turned directly up the hill, and in two
minutes were over the ridge. Instead of the
smooth pasture land they had just crossed this side
of the hill was of barren soil and covered with
boulders. To follow a trail here was scarcely
possible, but the two American boys soon found
traces of the Hun, where he had broken through
the bushes on the summit.</p>

<p>“We don’t know this country,” Whistler said
cautiously. “There may be lots of hide-outs
around here.”</p>

<p>“He doesn’t know it, either,” Belding declared.</p>

<p>“We don’t know that,” the other boy said
sharply. “They say every square foot of England
was mapped by German spies before the
war. Somehow, that Heinie slipping away the
way he did, looks fishy.”</p>

<p>“How so?”</p>

<p>“They always give up&mdash;these Zep crews. They
know the worst will happen to them is internment.
Running away like this will put him in dead
wrong, if he’s caught,” added Whistler.</p>

<p>“I suppose that’s so, Morgan,” agreed Belding.
“But maybe the poor fish was scared out of his
five senses.”</p>

<p>“Let Frenchy tell it, these Heinies don’t own
five senses,” Whistler chuckled. “He says they
haven’t got more than two.”</p>

<p>“Uh-huh. That might be. Maybe this fellow
ran for quite another reason.”</p>

<p>“What’s that?”</p>

<p>“Because he is a spy.”</p>

<p>Whistler digested that idea slowly. It looked
reasonable. He knew that it was said sometimes
the bombing machines dropped spies on British
soil.</p>

<p>“We’d better be careful, then,” he said at last.
“The chap may be armed.”</p>

<p>“No ‘maybe’ about it. He’s sure to be,” Belding
said vigorously. “We’d look nice getting shot
ashore here by a Heinie. What would our folks
say?”</p>

<p>“By the way, George,” Whistler Morgan said,
“how are your folks? Do you hear from them?
When did you come across the pond?”</p>

<p>“One at a time!” exclaimed Belding. “Lil
writes me&mdash;you remember my sister, Lilian?
She was all legs and lanky yellow hair when we
were up there in Seacove that summer.”</p>

<p>“I remember her,” Whistler admitted. “She’s
a pretty girl.”</p>

<p>“Huh! Think so? She isn’t a patch on your
sister, Alice, for looks. And that reminds me&mdash;have
you heard the news?”</p>

<p>“I’ve not heard much news from home lately,
if that is what you mean,” said Whistler. “Guess
my mail’s been delayed.”</p>

<p>“Why, say! let me tell you about it. First of
all, I came across two months ago and have been
on father’s yacht, the <i>Sirius</i>&mdash;sub. chaser, you
know. Course it isn’t called the <i>Sirius</i> any more.
He let the Navy Department have it, you know.”</p>

<p>“Why, George!” gasped Whistler, “I didn’t
know you folks had a yacht.”</p>

<p>“Father owns a slew of freight ships. It’s on
one of his ships that they are all sailing next
month for Bahia.”</p>

<p>“That’s in South America,” said Whistler
thoughtfully.</p>

<p>“Yes. Father thinks there is going to be the
biggest kind of commercial opportunity in Brazil
and other South American states after the war.
The Germans will be in bad down there. Father
is going to establish a branch of his business in
Bahia, and stay himself for a year or more&mdash;perhaps
until the war’s end.”</p>

<p>“You don’t say!”</p>

<p>“Yes, I do, Country!” laughed Belding. “And
Lil and mother are going to take your sisters with
them.”</p>

<p>“Wha&mdash;what’s that you say?” Whistler ejaculated,
in blank amazement.</p>

<p>“I guess you haven’t heard from home lately,”
Belding said. “Didn’t you know anything about
it?”</p>

<p>“Not a word.”</p>

<p>“They’ll sail on the <i>Redbird</i>. That’s one of
father’s biggest ships. You see, Doctor Morgan
was in New York and came to see us, so Lil wrote
me. And he said how much he desired to send
your sister Phoebe off on a long sea voyage. So
they made it up, right there and then. Your
sister Alice is going, too, and my mother will
chaperone the crowd. Tell you what, Phil, if it
wasn’t for this man’s war, I’d like to drop everything
here and go with them. Some sport! What
wouldn’t we do to those girls when the <i>Redbird</i>
crossed the equator!”</p>

<p>The boys had been standing in the lee of a big
rock while thus conversing in low tones. Suddenly
Whistler saw a movement on the hillside
below them. A man dived behind a boulder, disappearing
like a flash.</p>

<p>“There!” whispered Whistler. “I saw him!
Did you?”</p>

<p>“I saw something,” admitted Belding. “Wish
that big Johnny Bull friend of mine was here.”</p>

<p>“He’d be a bigger mark for a pistol ball&mdash;if the
Hun is armed&mdash;than we make!”</p>

<p>“Good-<i>night</i>!” breathed Belding. “I don’t wish
to consider myself as any such target.”</p>

<p>Nevertheless the two lads did not hesitate to
approach the spot where they had caught a glimpse
of the escaping German. Whistler Morgan, at
least, had been in many a perilous corner since
he had joined the Navy as apprentice seaman,
and he was not likely to show the white feather
now. As for George Belding, Whistler did not
know much about him; but when they were some
years younger and George had visited Seacove,
he seemed to be as courageous a boy as one would
wish to meet.</p>

<p>The boys on shore leave of course were without
arms of any description. And, as had been suggested,
the German might be armed. The Americans
took no chances in their search for the
enemy.</p>

<p>There was a big boulder just ahead, and at
Whistler’s suggestion the two climbed this and,
lying flat on their stomachs, wormed their way
to the summit, from which a better view of what
lay below on the side hill could be obtained.</p>

<p>“Sh! That’s the fellow!” hissed Belding, seizing
Whistler’s arm almost at once.</p>

<p>The Seacove boy saw the olive-gray figure at
the same moment. The two lay and watched the
German making himself comfortable in a little
hollow between two rocks some rods below their
station. The man had evidently scrutinized all
his surroundings and believed himself to be unobserved.</p>

<p>“What’s he got in his bundle?” whispered
George Belding.</p>

<p>“Got me. I saw he had that when he dropped
from the burning Zep.”</p>

<p>The two had not long to wait to learn just what
the man carried with him. Being assured that
he was alone, he dropped the bundle and proceeded
to untie it. Then he began to remove his flying
clothes.</p>

<p>“A disguise,” were the words Belding’s lips
mouthed, and Whistler nodded.</p>

<p>The latter was making a thorough scrutiny of
the German’s face. Whether they captured the
man or not he proposed to know him again if he
met him&mdash;no matter where.</p>

<p>He was lean-faced, with a prominent nose, and
eyes that Whistler thought were gray or a pale
blue. He wore a tuft of black whisker on his
chin and a little moustache. This, and the way he
wore his hair&mdash;long and shaggy&mdash;made him look
anything but Teutonic.</p>

<p>The boys beheld the fellow, stripped of his
outer garments, don loose trousers, a farmer’s
smock, and a cap. Although he did not look
English in the face, he was dressed much as the
boys had seen the neighboring agriculturists and
drovers dress. He even put on a pair of heavy
boots instead of the laced shoes he had worn in
the Zeppelin.</p>

<p>“That chap means business,” whispered Belding.
And then he suddenly grunted almost aloud,
for out of his bundle the spy produced a pair of
automatic pistols which he proceeded to hide
under the loose blouse he now wore.</p>

<p>“He is prepared to fight,” agreed Whistler
under his breath. “We can’t capture him without
help, George.”</p>

<p>“You’ve said something, Whistler! One of us
will have to go for help.”</p>

<p>“Which shall it be&mdash;you or I?” asked Phil in
the same cautious tone. “Al and the others would
be glad to be in on this.”</p>

<p>“And my friend Johnson, from the Old Kent
Road. He’s sober now and worth two ordinary
men in a scrimmage,” and Belding smiled broadly.</p>

<p>“Shall I go?”</p>

<p>“All right,” agreed Belding. “But be quick.
And if I’m not here, I’ll drop papers to show my
trail. I’ve plenty of old letters in my pocket to
tear up.”</p>

<p>“Good idea,” said Whistler, preparing to slide
feet first down the rock. “Don’t get into trouble
with that fellow, George.”</p>

<p>With this admonition he left the other American
lad and started back up the hill on the other
side of which the huge airship had fallen to the
earth.</p>


<h2 id='chIV'>CHAPTER IV&mdash;THE PAPER CHASE</h2>


<p>Once again on the summit of the hill Whistler
Morgan could overlook all the sloping pastureland
bordering the pleasant road he and his friends
had been strolling upon when the Zeppelin appeared;
and he could view all the port and the
harbor, as well.</p>

<p>It was no peaceful scene now. The bombing
of the port had done no damage to the shipping;
but there were fires burning in three places
in the town, as well as on the site of the schoolhouse
and where the Hun airship had fallen. No
second Zeppelin had appeared from the sea; but
the guarding airplanes had now gathered like vultures,
floating high above the port.</p>

<p>Whistler did not wish to look in the direction
of the schoolhouse site a second time. The shock
of the destruction of all those innocent children
was too fresh in his mind for him to be willing
to view the spot closer. The crowd gathered
about the steaming ruins were made up for the
most part, probably, of the bereaved parents and
friends of the victims.</p>

<p>In the opposite direction, up the road, where
the twisted wreck of the Zeppelin lay, the American
lad could distinguish the figures of some of
his friends. He hurried in that direction, and as
he drew near he saw that the crowd here gathered
was very much excited. The man who had previously
used the shotgun was waving his weapon
threateningly, and some of the other people of the
countryside were shouting at the group of gray-green
figures that was plainly the crew and officers
of the wrecked airship.</p>

<p>One of these Germans&mdash;a big fellow&mdash;showed
marks of a serious beating. He was the fellow,
Whistler was sure, that Willum Johnson had attacked.</p>

<p>The giant British seaman and the <i>Colodia</i> boys
were right up in the forefront of the threatening
crowd facing the Germans. But Whistler saw
that there was a British Naval officer and several
constables in charge of the prisoners.</p>

<p>“Remember, my man, that you wear the King’s
uniform,” the British officer was saying to the
giant as Phil approached. “I shall have to report
your attack upon this prisoner. They all gave
themselves up&mdash;”</p>

<p>“And they were all armed&mdash;every one of them,”
put in Frenchy, <i>sotto voce</i>.</p>

<p>The officer glared at him; but it gave Willum
Johnson courage to add:</p>

<p>“Who says they didn’t try to escape? Hi got
the first bloke hout of the machine, Hi did. Then
hother folks run up an’ ’twas hall over.”</p>

<p>“I saw <i>one</i> run,” Frenchy declared, looking
boldly at the Naval officer.</p>

<p>“So did I, sir,” added Al Torrance.</p>

<p>“You mean that one of these Germans tried to
run after the seaman here made his unwarranted
attack upon them?” asked the officer sharply.</p>

<p>“Bill jumped on the first fellow out of the
machine,” Al said with confidence. “The second
chap ran up over that ridge and disappeared.”</p>

<p>“Nonsense!” exclaimed the officer. “Here are
fourteen&mdash;all that were in the crew, so their commander
says.”</p>

<p>“And Hi wouldn’t believe him if ’ee swore hit
hon a stack of Bibles as ’igh as a ’ouse!” cried the
Coster.</p>

<p>Just at this juncture Whistler Morgan interfered.
He said very respectfully to the Navy
officer:</p>

<p>“Beg pardon, sir, but the German that escaped
is over behind the hill now. One of my chums
and I chased him, and&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Do you mean to tell me there were fifteen
members of the crew of this Zeppelin?”</p>

<p>“I’m not sure of that. He may not have been
an accredited member. I think he is a spy brought
over for some purpose and dropped here.”</p>

<p>“You know where he is?” demanded the officer.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir. My friend is watching him now.
He had a bundle with a disguise and pistols in it.
You’d never know him for a German the way he
looks now.”</p>

<p>“Horray for Whistler, fellows!” shouted Al
Torrance. “Let’s all go after the Heinie!”</p>

<p>The boys from the <i>Colodia</i> started away from
the wreck at once, but the British Naval officer
called after them:</p>

<p>“Hold on, my lads. I can’t have you going
alone on such a mission. If there really is a spy
at large&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“He’s at large, all right, sir,” Morgan interposed.
“Give us Willum Johnson and we’ll get
the fellow, sure.”</p>

<p>“Aye, lad!” cried the giant sailor. “We’ll git
’im, dead or alive.”</p>

<p>“You see that you get him <i>alive</i>, Bill,” said the
officer, sternly. “No mistake about that. I’ll
have to explain your pounding this fellow all up.”</p>

<p>“Bli’me!” said Johnson, “Hi didn’t begin to
treat ’im rough enough.”</p>

<p>But this was under his breath and after he had
turned away to follow the four Navy Boys. The
officer did not hear the comment.</p>

<p>By Whistler’s advice they all stooped at the
summit and crept over the ridge among the bushes
and rocks, endeavoring to keep their bodies out
of the view of anybody below on the hillside,
where Phil had left George Belding and the German
spy.</p>

<p>“Hit’s a fair chance, lads, they seed me,” remarked
the British seaman. “But mebbe they’d
spot muh for a bloomin’ cow!”</p>

<p>“Where’s that other fellow, Whistler?” asked
Al. “Belding, did you call him?”</p>

<p>“Yes. You ought to remember him, Torry.
He was all one summer at Seacove. And say!
his folks and my folks are in the most wonderful
mix-up&mdash;wait till I get a chance to tell you all
about it!”</p>

<p>The party dodged from rock to rock and from
one clump of brush to another. Soon Whistler
was rather surprised that they did not spy George
Belding. He was not lying on the big rock where
Whistler had left him.</p>

<p>“W’ere’s your chum, lad?” asked Willum Johnson.</p>

<p>“I guess the spy must have moved. George
would follow him,” Whistler said with confidence.</p>

<p>“But how shall we know which way they have
gone? We’re no Red Indians on the trail,”
Frenchy observed.</p>

<p>“Oi, oi!” added Ikey Rosenmeyer. “It’s near
sunset, too.”</p>

<p>“Don’t be afeared, lad,” advised the big sailor,
wagging his head. “Nothing will bite yuh around
’ere.”</p>

<p>Whistler then explained that Belding had
agreed to drop bits of paper by which they might
follow his trail, and this encouraged them all.
Near the rock and the hollow in which Whistler
himself had seen the spy change his clothes they
found no sign of either Belding or the Hun.</p>

<p>The latter must have carried his bundle of
clothing with him when he moved from this spot.
It was some minutes before Ikey’s sharp eyes
descried the first handful of torn paper which
George Belding had dropped.</p>

<p>“Here’s the trail!” he shouted.</p>

<p>“Hush up, youngster!” commanded Al Torrance.
“Want to tell everybody all you know?”</p>

<p>“And it wouldn’t take him long at that&mdash;unless
he stuttered,” said Frenchy, pounding Ikey between
the shoulders.</p>

<p>“Oi, oi! I forgot,” explained Rosenmeyer,
hoarsely. “Let up, Mike Donahue! Who are
you taking for a bass drum?”</p>

<p>“Come on now, fellows,” Whistler said, leading
the way. “Keep together and try to make as little
noise as possible. We don’t know how near that
spy may be.”</p>

<p>He had already found the second bunch of torn
paper. Torry, walking close behind him, asked:
“Will you know that German if you see him,
Whistler?”</p>

<p>“Sure. He’s dressed like one of these farmers
or drovers. But he’s got a goatee and a little
moustache. He doesn’t look German at all.”</p>

<p>“You lads just point ’im hout to me!” grumbled
Willum Johnson, walking next in line after Torry.</p>

<p>They got into a piece of woods after a little,
finding that the paper trail led along a well defined
path. Whether the German spy knew, or
did not know, this part of England, he seemed to
have a direct object in view, if George Belding’s
trail was a thing to judge by.</p>

<p>This wood was nothing like the ordinary woods
the American boys were used to around Seacove.
It was cleared out like a grove, all the dry limbs
lopped off the trees and stacked in certain places
for firewood, and even the hedges thinned out for
the same purpose.</p>

<p>“Why,” Al Torrance said, “we’d burn all that
stuff as rubbish, wouldn’t we, Whistler?”</p>

<p>“And <i>that</i>,” agreed his chum, unpuckering his
lips, “is why firewood at home is worth twenty
dollars a cord.”</p>

<p>“Wot’s that?” gasped Willum Johnson. “Four
pun a cord? My heye! hit’s no wonder there’s so
many millionaires in Hamerica. Ye <i>’ave</i> to be a
millionaire to live there&mdash;eh, wot?”</p>

<p>“Right you are, man,” said Al. “Hi! where’s
the next bunch of paper, Whistler?”</p>

<p>It seemed that the trail of paper fragments
stopped abruptly. The party scattered through
the wood, searching thoroughly for yards on
either side of the path.</p>

<p>“Perhaps he ran out of paper,” suggested
Frenchy.</p>

<p>Whistler, who was ahead, suddenly came to
the edge of a hollow&mdash;a steep fall of some ten or
a dozen feet. He parted the bushes and peered
down into this hole. Then he uttered a startled
cry that brought the others to the spot on the run.</p>


<h2 id='chV'>CHAPTER V&mdash;THE TRICKSTER</h2>


<p>“Easy, boy!” Al Torrance advised, hearing
Whistler’s cry of surprise. “Want to give us away
to that Heinie if he is in hearing?”</p>

<p>But Whistler Morgan, after his startled exclamation,
burst through the bushes and hurried
down the bank of the hollow. A figure lay at
the bottom&mdash;a figure dressed in a blue smock,
loose trousers, heavy shoes and a cap. The cap
was pulled down over the person’s face, and he
was rolled sideways so that Whistler could not
distinguish a feature.</p>

<p>There was, however, something besides these
points that had caused Whistler’s ejaculation and
excitement.</p>

<p>“Cracky!” gasped Al, remembering the description
his chum had so recently given of the disguise
the German spy had donned. “Is that the fellow?
And who triced him up that way? Looks like
somebody has been ahead of us.”</p>

<p>The other two Navy Boys and Willum Johnson
joined Al Torrance at the top of the bank. They,
too, saw the huddled figure below over which
Whistler was standing.</p>

<p>“Oi, oi!” exploded Ikey characteristically.
“They got him tied up ready for the spit yet.”</p>

<p>“Is that the bloomin’ spy?” growled the big
British seaman. “Let me get me ’ands on ’im.”</p>

<p>“Easy, Bill,” said Al Torrance. “You know
what that brass hat said about your bringing the
spy in alive.”</p>

<p>“Hi wouldn’t kill ’im&mdash;now I’m cooled hoff,”
the ex-coster declared. “But ’ee won’t get awye
from hus&mdash;no fear!”</p>

<p>Whistler had not joined in this conversation.
He turned the body over and Frenchy uttered an
ear-piercing yell:</p>

<p>“What do you know about that?” he added.
“It’s George Belding!”</p>

<p>“Say!” growled Al. “They could hear you on
the <i>Colodia</i>. If that spy is here&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“He’s got far enough away by this time!”
Whistler exclaimed, swiftly getting out his knife
to cut Belding’s bonds.</p>

<p>The latter was gagged most cruelly with a stick
tied between his jaws. So far had the stick been
thrust into the lad’s mouth that the corners were
cracked and bleeding. Whistler cut away his
friend’s gag first of all.</p>

<p>“The nasty villain!” cried Willum Johnson.
“’Ow did ’ee do hit?”</p>

<p>“Are you hurt, George?” demanded Morgan.</p>

<p>“I’m bumped some,” admitted the other
American lad. “But I’m hurt most in my dignity,” and
he tried to grin.</p>

<p>“The scoundrel cut your lips with that stick,”
said Al Torrance. “Where did he go?”</p>

<p>“Ask me something easier. I only know he
went&mdash;and if he kept on the way he started he’s
a long way from here by now.”</p>

<p>“But where are your clothes?” demanded
Whistler Morgan.</p>

<p>“What do you think?” cried Belding. “The
dirty Heinie is wearing them!”</p>

<p>“Good-<i>night</i>!” gasped Frenchy. “Is it a U. S.
sailor he wants to be?”</p>

<p>“Tell us!” commanded Whistler earnestly.</p>

<p>“Why, you see,” Belding responded, getting up
now after having rubbed his chafed ankles, “it
was like this: Just as soon as you got out of sight,
Morgan, the Heinie began to travel. I started
right after him, and he came down here into this
wood. I believe I wasn’t very smart&mdash;or he was
smarter than I. Guess that is pretty well proved
isn’t it?” and Belding smiled wryly.</p>

<p>“I had in mind all the time that he had two
pistols under this smock he wore, so I tried not
to attract his attention. You can see I failed in
my attempt.”</p>

<p>“How did it happen?” Whistler asked.</p>

<p>“I stepped on a stick. I suppose that was what
put him wise to me. Anyway, the stick cracked.
I jumped behind a tree. I could see him ahead of
me in the path and he did not turn his head or
apparently hear the crackling stick. But he must
have been sharper than I thought.”</p>

<p>“These ’ere ’Uns,” declared Willum Johnson,
“is hup to all sorts o’ tricks.”</p>

<p>“He was a trickster, all right,” agreed George
Belding, with much disgust in his tone of voice.
“I followed right along like the idiot I was, and
all of a sudden the fellow disappeared. I thought
he had moved faster, so I went faster.”</p>

<p>“And then what?” asked Al.</p>

<p>“I came up to the tree he was hiding behind,
and he stepped out and stuck one of those pistols
of his right under my nose!”</p>

<p>“What d’you know about that?” marveled
Frenchy.</p>

<p>“Never had that happen to you, did you?” asked
George Belding. “It’s the funniest feeling&mdash;believe
me! The muzzle of the pistol was under
my nose, but I felt it right at the pit of my stomach!
I couldn’t do a thing, of course. You see
fellows disarm an antagonist in moving pictures
without getting hurt, but I wasn’t going to take
a chance. I know he would have blown my head
off.”</p>

<p>“What did he do to you then?” asked Ikey
Rosenmeyer, his eyes big with interest.</p>

<p>“He drove me before him down into this
hollow. He had got rid of his bundle somewhere.
I didn’t see him drop it. His uniform, you know,
Morgan.”</p>

<p>“I see.”</p>

<p>“And down here he made me strip off my
clothes&mdash;even my shoes. I tell you, I just <i>hate</i> that
Heinie.”</p>

<p>“That’s wot yuh wants to do,” growled Willum
Johnson. “’Ate the ’Un or yuh can’t lick ’im
proper.”</p>

<p>“No fear,” said Belding, nodding. “I have
stored up a proper hate for them now. This
fellow is the meanest of the bunch. He got out
of the duds I am wearing as slick as you please&mdash;keeping
me under the muzzle of his gun all the
time.”</p>

<p>“Sounds just like a wild west movie, doesn’t
it?” suggested Ikey.</p>

<p>“Nothing so good&mdash;don’t think it,” growled
George Belding.</p>

<p>“Anyhow, he got these things off and made me
get into them. He put on my uniform meanwhile&mdash;quick
as a cat he is. You got a good look at
him, didn’t you, Morgan?”</p>

<p>“I’d know him again,” declared Whistler
grimly.</p>

<p>“So would I,” said Belding, shaking his head
threateningly. “But what good is that? I bet
we never set eyes on the scamp again.”</p>

<p>“My heye!” exclaimed the big British seaman,
“let’s ’unt ’im down.”</p>

<p>“He’s had half an hour’s start,” said Belding,
hopelessly. “And he was going some when he
started&mdash;believe me! We’d never catch him.”</p>

<p>“’Ow do you know?” returned Willum Johnson.
“Let’s send these little nippers,” indicating
Frenchy and Ikey, “back to the bloomin’
port for ’elp, hand then scour the ’ole bloomin’
country.”</p>

<p>“We’d better all go back and report,” Whistler
Morgan said seriously. “We fellows can’t be
much longer ashore, Mr. Johnson. We’re due at
the dock pretty soon.”</p>

<p>“Bli’me!” exclaimed the man. “Hi’ve overstayed
my leave already. Hin for a penny, hin for
a pun, say Hi!”</p>

<p>But Whistler argued with him, and he became
more reasonable. Now that the fumes of alcohol
were out of his head he was rather a tractable
fellow.</p>

<p>“There is going to be trouble over this,” Al
Torrance prophesied. “We’d better give the alarm
in a hurry. That Hun must be captured before
he does some damage.”</p>

<p>“He can go almost anywhere in a Yankee uniform&mdash;if
he speaks English,” said Whistler.</p>

<p>“Oh, he speaks it all right,” said Belding.</p>

<p>“Hif Hi could honly ’ave got me ’ands hon
’im!” groaned Willum Johnson, shaking his
shaggy head sorrowfully.</p>

<p>But Belding had something very serious to say
to Whistler Morgan as the party started to climb
out of the wood to the top of the hill overlooking
the port and harbor.</p>

<p>“No use talking about it, Morgan,” he said,
“but I never took my money out of my clothes.
I had a couple of pounds besides silver.”</p>

<p>“Too bad.”</p>

<p>“And that is not the worst. I had papers and
letters. Some things in the letters from my father
I wouldn’t want many folks to see&mdash;and especially
a Hun. Father is going to take a big sum in
cash with him on the <i>Redbird</i> when he sails for
Bahia. Gold, Morgan&mdash;thousands and thousands
of dollars in gold coin.”</p>

<p>“Whew!”</p>

<p>“Some prize for a Hun U-boat! And think of
my folks and your sisters aboard the <i>Redbird</i>!
It’s going to worry me until I know this scoundrel
is captured and I get back my papers.”</p>


<h2 id='chVI'>CHAPTER VI&mdash;WORK AHEAD</h2>


<p>When the four Navy Boys and their friends
came over the summit of the hill behind the
English seaport which the Zeppelin had so recently
raided and where it had come to grief, the
bomb-set fires in the town had become controlled.
Even the conflagration at the point where the
Zeppelin had fallen was now entirely smothered.</p>

<p>Fortunately neither the marine hospital nor the
port admiral’s headquarters had been hit by the
Hun bombs. The first named was crowded with
refugees from merchant ships sunk by the Hun
submarines or blown up by floating mines. Almost
daily the remnants of the unfortunate crews were
brought in; for by this time the Germans had
begun shelling the boats as they escaped from
sinking ships, striving to carry out their master’s
orders, “that no trace be left” of such breaking
of the international law agreed to long since by
all civilized nations.</p>

<p>But if the hospital was not hit, damage enough
had been done in all good conscience. The crowds
were gone from about the wrecked Zeppelin and
from the bombed schoolhouse. The shelling of
open boats at sea was not a greater crime than
the indiscriminate dropping of bombs on this unfortified
town; and the wiping out of that school
teacher and her pupils could never be forgotten.
Phil Morgan turned his eyes away from the place,
shuddering as he thought of the horror.</p>

<p>“Let’s go down to the admiral’s station&mdash;there
where his white ensign flies&mdash;and report about the
spy escaping from us,” Whistler said.</p>

<p>“And explain how he’s dressed,” Al Torrance
added. “For let me tell you, that chap, speaking
English and all, and dressed like one of us Yanks,
will cause a lot of trouble.”</p>

<p>“I’d like to get something decent to put on myself,”
grumbled George Belding.</p>

<p>“Tee, hee!” giggled Ikey Rosenmeyer. “You
don’t look any more like one of these farmers
than nothin’ at all!”</p>

<p>“Must say,” grinned Whistler, “the clothes
don’t become you, George.”</p>

<p>“You go fish!” snapped the unfortunate. “I
hate to show up aboard and face&mdash;who’s your
boss, Lieutenant Commander Lang, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Cracky! Yes,” Al said. “And you are billed
for the old <i>Colodia</i>? Say, the boys will give you
a welcome!”</p>

<p>“How did you come to get billeted to the
<i>Colodia</i>?” Whistler Morgan asked curiously.
“You came over on your father’s yacht?”</p>

<p>“No,” said Belding, quietly. “I didn’t say that.
I joined the crew of the one-time <i>Sirius</i> because
when I arrived in England your old <i>Colodia</i> was
out scrapping with the part of the Hun fleet that
tried to make a break.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes,” said Whistler. “We were in that
fight; but we were on the <i>Kennebunk</i>.”</p>

<p>“And our gun made the first hit and we sunk
a Hun battleship!” cried Al.</p>

<p>“Huh!” scoffed Frenchy, “you listen to Al and
Whistler, and you’d think their old gun fought
the whole battle.”</p>

<p>“Did you fellows really help work a gun in that
fight?” cried George Belding, in amazement and
admiration. Even the giant British seaman gazed
at the Navy Boys with increased respect.</p>

<p>“We were in the fight, and we belonged to one
of the gun crews,” admitted Whistler. “But we
are willing to agree that we did not do it all.
Frenchy and Ikey were there.”</p>

<p>Belding laughed. “Well, let’s go along to the
admiral’s, and I’ll tell you how I came to get billeted
on the <i>Colodia</i>. Uncle Sam is training more
men than he has boats for&mdash;yet. But the <i>Colodia’s</i>
lost several of her crew, hasn’t she, from one
cause or another?”</p>

<p>“Of course. And are you a ‘filler-in’?” said
Whistler.</p>

<p>“Guess so. I came over expecting to go right
aboard the destroyer, as I say. But I had to wait
for her to come back from the North Sea. And
there was the old <i>Sirius</i>, with a chap in command
that I knew. So I got a chance to take a trip. We
took out a convoy bound westward; and on the
way back we had a scrap with a sub.”</p>

<p>“Did you sink her?” asked Frenchy eagerly.</p>

<p>“We did something to it. The boys said they
knew she was a goner. Oil and litter rose to the
surface after we dropped a depth bomb. I’m sorry
for her crew; but they are in bad business.”</p>

<p>“Don’t yuh be too bloomin’ sorry for the filthy
’Uns,” growled Willum Johnson.</p>

<p>“Say, Big Bill,” sang out Frenchy, “don’t you
be so bloodthirsty. You are a regular tiger&mdash;to
hear you talk.”</p>

<p>“Don’t forget them school kids down there,”
replied the man, shaking his head.</p>

<p>Whistler had hoped to put the memory of the
innocents butchered by the Zeppelin out of his
memory for a few minutes. He shuddered, and
led the way into the head of one of the steep
streets, lined on either side by white painted cottages.</p>

<p>The streets leading down to the harbor were
so steep that Al said he always felt like putting
out his hands to brace himself against the walls
of the little houses as they went down.</p>

<p>The boys grew silent when they heard the
weeping and wailing from inside the houses. Here the
children had lived who were so mangled in the
explosion of the Hun bomb. The destruction
below in the middle of the town could not have
been so bad, for there were few women and
children there. This was not market day.</p>

<p>It scarcely seemed possible that the raid should
have been accomplished and done so much damage
ashore three hours before. The harbor lay peacefully
enough now in the last light of the setting
sun. The ships of the merchant fleet, all camouflaged
most fantastically, lay swinging at their
moorings. There were several gray cruisers and
a number of destroyers, for this was a busy port.
Both foodstuffs and troops were landed here. The
destroyers were all so painted that one could
scarcely be distinguished from another. Only the
four Navy Boys knew just where the <i>Colodia</i> was
anchored.</p>

<p>The party arrived at the admiral’s station and
were stopped by the sentinel at the gate. The
admiral was not at his desk, for he was out viewing
the damage the bombs had done, and to interview
the prisoners brought in.</p>

<p>But there was an officer who heard the boys’
report and thanked them for what they had tried
to do. George Belding gave a complete description
of the daring spy who had landed from the
Zeppelin. It was pretty sure that he and Whistler
Morgan would know the fellow if they ever came
face-to-face with him again.</p>

<p>The ex-coster would have to face punishment
when he got aboard his ship.</p>

<p>“Hit’s me for the dungeon,” was the way he
expressed his expectation of spending some time
in the ship’s brig. “Good-bye, lads,” he said on
parting from the Americans. “Yuh’re a bloomin’
bunch o’ sports, that’s wot’ yuh his. There’s no
manner o’ doubt you Hamericans is hall right.”</p>

<p>“And you are all right, Bill, when you are
sober,” George Belding said rather grumpily. “I
hope I’ll never meet you again when you have
been indulging in liquor.”</p>

<p>He said this with feeling; but Big Bill only
grinned. “You’ll ’ave to visit me haboard ship,
lad,” he said, shaking his head. “Wot’s bred hin
the bone his bloomin’ ’ard to change, hand don’t
yuh forget hit!”</p>

<p>George Belding merely grunted. He was in no
pleasant mood because of the “hick” costume, as
Frenchy called it, which he was obliged to wear
aboard ship. The ridiculous garments and shoes
occasioned much hilarity when they reached the
<i>Colodia’s</i> launch.</p>

<p>“Hey! what you got there? Going to bring a
cow along for him to milk?” was the jocular
demand.</p>

<p>Isa Bopp, who would never be anything but a
greenhorn himself, no matter how long he was at
sea, demanded:</p>

<p>“Where did you fellers pick up that farmer?”</p>

<p>“Farmer yourself!” whispered Ikey behind the
sharp of his hand. “It’s the port admiral in disguise.
He’s going aboard to see Commander
Lang on a secret mission. Something big’s coming
off, Isa.”</p>

<p>“There’ll be something big come off when he
shucks them shoes,” chuckled Bopp.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Phil Morgan was explaining to the
petty officer in charge of the launch just who
George Belding was, and how he came to be without
a uniform. Belding would otherwise have
had trouble getting aboard the <i>Colodia</i>, without
his papers that the spy had run away with.</p>

<p>The loiterers were soon brought in by the guard
and the launch put off for the destroyer. It was
dark when they arrived at the <i>Colodia</i>. Ensign
MacMasters, the Navy Boys’ very good friend,
was at the gangway, and he passed Belding on
Whistler’s word. Phil and the new boy went at
once to Commander Lang.</p>

<p>It was eight bells, and the anchor watch was
just being mustered. There was no searchlight
or signal drills on this evening because of the air
raid. There might be other Zeppelins in the fog
that hung over the sea.</p>

<p>The boys coming aboard at once swung their
hammocks and had a chance before the first call
at 8:55 to visit around with their friends and swap
experiences. Of course, everybody was excited
over the air raid; but nobody had been in the thick
of it as had Philip Morgan and his chums.</p>

<p>As there is no smoking allowed below the main
deck after 7:30 p. m. the lads could gather on the
berth deck and talk until the first anchor watch
was set. Then the thrill of the boatswain’s pipe
called for silence on the berth deck and the boys
that were not on watch or already in their hammocks
prepared swiftly to be under covers when
taps was sounded at five minutes past nine.</p>

<p>But on this night, almost immediately after nine
o’clock, there was a chattering of the wireless.
The boys on watch saw the messenger dash along
the deck from the wireless station with the message
for the commander.</p>

<p>A murmur passed from group to group about
the main deck of the destroyer. It even seeped
below, and the boys who were not yet asleep heard
the whisper.</p>

<p>Orders! Something of moment afoot that had
not been expected; for the <i>Colodia</i> was not supposed
to leave port till the next day.</p>

<p>Whistler, whose watch it was, almost stumbled
against Ensign MacMasters in the waist of the
ship. It was the ensign’s own fault, for he was on
the starboard side.</p>

<p>“Hello, my boy!” he said to Phil. “Heard the
news?”</p>

<p>“I know there is news, sir,” said Whistler. “But
I don’t know what it is.”</p>

<p>“You’ll all know soon. We’ll up anchor and
sail in half an hour. Orders from the port admiral.
He has got information from the prisoners
that there may be another Zeppelin fallen
in the sea outside. They saw her fall, and it may
be possible for us to rescue some of her company.”</p>

<p>“More of the baby-killing Heinies?” exclaimed
Whistler.</p>

<p>“Ah, well, we have to be merciful,” said the ensign.
“They were obeying their orders. We
must obey ours.”</p>

<p>“But you know, Mr. MacMasters,” said Morgan
earnestly, “if our superiors ordered us to
commit the crimes the Huns commit, there would
be mighty few of us who would obey orders.”</p>

<p>“Aye, aye, my lad,” sighed the older man.
“But remember we have not lived under Prussian
masters all our lives. We have different teaching
and different ideals, thank God!”</p>

<p>In ten minutes the whole ship’s company was
making ready for departure.</p>


<h2 id='chVII'>CHAPTER VII&mdash;ON THE GREY WATERS</h2>


<p>For the most part the American destroyers on
duty in British and French waters were doing
patrol service, scouting over designated areas in
quest of enemy submarines, meeting and escorting
troop and merchant ships into port, and on occasion,
when the S O S calls came, rushing to the
aid of torpedoed or of mined craft.</p>

<p>Even during the short experience Philip Morgan
and his chums had had on the <i>Colodia</i>, they
had often seen the wreckage-littered waters where
ships had gone down and men and women had
suffered exposure in lifeboats.</p>

<p>The destroyer had roared through the grey
seas, in fog and gale and darkness, in answer to
the tragic calls for help. Never, since men went
down to the sea in ships, had there been such
adventure on the waves as in those years of the
World War.</p>

<p>For never before had the sharklike submarine
abounded nor the airplanes swept overhead, both
carrying death and destruction. When the <i>Colodia</i>
left port her crew had small surety that they
would return. This present night call was a new
one for them.</p>

<p>The crew of the supposedly wrecked Zeppelin
had been possibly five hours in the sea when the
captured Germans told of their comrades’ fate.
The British port admiral had communicated with
Commander Lang within a few minutes of his
hearing the tragic tale.</p>

<p>There was perhaps a particular reason why the
order to find the wreck of the Zeppelin and her
crew (if they were not drowned) was given to
one of the American destroyers instead of to a
British patrol boat.</p>

<p>After all, the Yankees could not feel the same
degree of bitterness and hatred of the Hun and
his works as the British sailor did. The murder
of the school children and their teacher was known
to every British sailor in the port. To their
horror was added personal bitterness. And this
order sent the <i>Colodia</i> on a mission of mercy!</p>

<p>“The best I can hope for them,” said Morgan
to George Belding, who had been placed in Whistler’s
watch and had donned such uniform as the
master-at-arms could supply him, “is that they
will all be comfortably drowned before we find
any trace of the Zep. That maybe is wicked; but
it is the way I feel.”</p>

<p>“That would be better than they deserve,”
Belding agreed. “Just think what that spy did to
me!”</p>

<p>He was still very much disturbed in his mind
regarding the loss of his letters and valuable
papers.</p>

<p>“Why, you can’t tell, Phil,” said he, “what the
Huns might try to do. If they read father’s letters
and learned about all that gold&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“You really mean the <i>Redbird</i> will take out
treasure to Bahia?” asked Whistler in great concern.</p>

<p>“Yes. More gold coin than there is any use
talking about,” whispered Belding. “Father knew
I would be interested in all the details, so he told
me.”</p>

<p>“And my sisters and your mother and Lilian
going along!” sighed Whistler.</p>

<p>“Nice mess, isn’t it?” groaned the other. “That
spy will make use of the information sure!&mdash;if
he can.”</p>

<p>“When will the <i>Redbird</i> sail?”</p>

<p>“Next month, some time. Of course, I’ll try to
send father word about this. But you know what
the censor does to a fellow’s letters. And to cable
would be worse.”</p>

<p>“Wait a minute!” cried Whistler. “That spy
couldn’t benefit very well by the information himself.
He’s here in England and your father’s
ship will sail from New York, won’t it?”</p>

<p>“I suppose so. From ‘an Atlantic port.’ You
know, that’s as near as they would let him tell in
a letter. And don’t worry about the Huns not
being benefited by the information. They’ll find
some way. They have wireless stations along
our United States coast. And every U-boat carries
a wireless.”</p>

<p>“So do our subs,” Whistler rejoined. “But
they are of small radius. The English coast is
cleaned out of Hun radio stations.”</p>

<p>“They have ’em on the islands off Ireland and
Scotland,” returned Belding. “That spy is some
smart chap, Phil. I’m awfully worried. I’ll write
father, of course, as clearly as the censorship
will allow. But it may be too late. The <i>Redbird</i>
may have sailed&mdash;or a U-boat may sink the mail
ship.”</p>

<p>“You don’t want to lose your courage over it,”
advised the Seacove youth. “We mustn’t expect
the worst. Of course, with Phoebe and Alice
aboard I shall be worried until we hear that they
have arrived safely at Bahia.”</p>

<p>“And it takes a long time for a sailing ship to
reach that place from our North Atlantic seaports,”
responded Belding.</p>

<p>They talked thus in whispers while hanging to
a wire stay. The <i>Colodia</i> was running without
lights, every inboard lamp carefully screened,
although the night was black. Before Whistler
and Belding went off watch it had begun to rain,
and a fierce, chill wind was blowing. The sea
was beginning to kick up, and a sailor had to be
a good acrobat to get into his hammock on the
destroyer.</p>

<p>The new watch went on deck in rubber boots
and slickers, and the gun crews, who were always
on duty at sea, day or night, sought such cover
as they could find. It was a nasty voyage, and
they were not inspired with the thought that they
might be able to save the Germans’ lives.</p>

<p>The bearings of the spot where the second
Zeppelin had fallen had been given to the port
admiral and by him transferred to Commander
Lang with precision. It was a long run to this
point, the boys knew. The destroyer could not
possibly make the point indicated before daybreak.</p>

<p>Yet most of the younger members of the crew,
whether it was their call or not, were up in season
for five o’clock coffee. The excitement grew as
the light became stronger and more could be seen
of the gray, tossing sea.</p>

<p>It was a bad lookout for rescuing anybody.
To put out a boat in such a sea would be a task
that the hardiest of the <i>Colodia’s</i> crew shrank
from. Now and then a comber rose over the destroyer’s
rail and tried to wash her deck. But
the thousand-ton fast steamer escaped most of
these “old he waves” as Boatswain Hans Hertig
called them.</p>

<p>Hertig was from Seacove, too, and was a particularly
good friend of Whistler and his chums.
“Seven Knott” was his nickname aboard the
<i>Colodia</i>, and the boys had had many adventures
afloat and ashore in his company.</p>

<p>“I ain’t got much use for them squareheads,”
Hans declared, “and after what they done back
there, I dunno as these fellers, what would have
done the same had they reached land, should be
helped yet.”</p>

<p>“Not much likelihood of our finding them at
all,” one of the other men said. “Ten hours in
the water now! And the bag of the Zep is bound
to fill with water and sink the whole framework.
Those Heinies will be kicking about in pretty wet
water.”</p>

<p>This was the attitude of most of the crew; yet
there was great curiosity among them to see what
was left of the Zeppelin that had fallen into the
sea. Commander Lang conferred with the navigation
officer and his other chiefs. The <i>Colodia</i>
had reached the spot indicated in their orders
from the port admiral.</p>

<p>Now all they could do was to sweep in circles
about the designated place and keep an extra
sharp lookout.</p>

<p>In fact, every man who could get on deck was
watching the tumbling seas for any sign of wreck
or castaway. After all, as the minutes passed and
nothing at all was descried where they had expected
to find survivors of the Zeppelin, even the
roughest members of the crew stopped growling
about “the Heinies.”</p>

<p>It was one thing to give vent to the bitterness
they felt against the Germans in speech, it was
another thing to think of those fourteen or sixteen
men struggling for so many hours in the icy
water, and finally being drowned so miserably.</p>

<p>The hammock stowers had just stopped down
the hammock cloths and the boys had got their
mess gear preparatory for breakfast at 7:30 A. M.
when there came a hail from the mast. One of the
lookouts had descried something in the east. He
pointed, and excitedly yelled his directions to the
watch officer.</p>

<p>The <i>Colodia’s</i> engines began to speed up. When
she went her full thirty-odd knots her hull shook
as though she would rattle to pieces. The life
of a destroyer in such work as the <i>Colodia</i> had
been doing since she was launched, can be only a
few months. Commander Lang was already talking
to his officers of the time when she would
have to be scrapped.</p>

<p>Meanwhile her record would amply repay the
Navigation Bureau for building her. There was
no doubt of that.</p>

<p>Now she pounded away at top speed for the
point where the lookout had seen something afloat
on the tumbling seas. All through this trip, not
only the destroyer’s commander, but many of the
more thoughtful members of the crew, had half
suspected a German trick.</p>

<p>It would not be outside of possibility, or probability,
for the crew of the Zeppelin brought down
ashore to send a rescue ship to sea into a trap
arranged with the usual German ruthlessness. It
was possible that there had been no second Zeppelin
at all, but that the <i>Colodia</i> was steaming at
her best pace to a rendezvous with a U-boat prepared
to torpedo her.</p>

<p>Tricks quite as vile had been played before by
the Hun. Commander Lang, with his binoculars
to his eyes, got the spot on the sea that the lookout
had observed and kept his glasses trained there.
It certainly was not a periscope they saw, yet it
might be some wreckage held together for the
special purpose of masking a periscope.</p>

<p>The gun crews were at their stations and the
men handling the depth bombs were ready on
either side, and fore and aft, to drop the deadly
explosives if it was found that the <i>Colodia</i> had
run into a trap.</p>


<h2 id='chVIII'>CHAPTER VIII&mdash;THE YANKEE WAY</h2>


<p>The sharp hull of the three hundred foot destroyer
cut through rather than rode the waves.
She was seaworthy enough, but in a cross sea like
this, she rolled and dipped tremendously, as well
as bucking right through the combers after the
fashion of a pilot fish. One had to be well seasoned
to her habit to stand such a tumbling about
as the <i>Colodia</i> gave her crew.</p>

<p>If George Belding felt any qualms, he was able
to repress them. He was a good sailor anyway,
and having just come from a stiff cruise in the
Bay of Biscay in his father’s transformed yacht,
he proved himself to be a tolerable seaman.</p>

<p>Belding was a manly fellow without being as
rough as many of the sailors. Like the four Navy
Boys, he was greatly interested by the view they
all acquired very soon of the floating débris that
had first been spied from the mast. The distance
being so great, they could not immediately be sure
whether the wreck was that of a boat or an airship.
It was at first merely a blotch of darker
color on the tumbling grey sea.</p>

<p>“Looks more like a dead whale with a framework
of scantling about it than anything else,”
Ensign MacMasters told the boys.</p>

<p>“It might be a whale at that,” commented Al
Torrance eagerly. “They say that many a whale
has been killed by depth bombs.”</p>

<p>“Hi!” ejaculated Frenchy Donahue. “There’s
a flag flying from a staff. I can see it.”</p>

<p>“No dead whale would be likely to fly a flag,”
Whistler said, smiling.</p>

<p>“Commander Lang had better have a care,”
grumbled George Belding. “This may be a trap,
after all.”</p>

<p>The <i>Colodia</i> steamed on at undiminished speed.
The outlines of the wreckage grew clearer despite
the raging rainstorms that swept now and then
across the gray waves.</p>

<p>The vast hulk of a collapsed bag of silk cloth&mdash;it
was never canvas&mdash;could have belonged to nothing
but one of the German airships.</p>

<p>“Half sunken Zep, sure as you are a foot high!”
declared Al Torrance.</p>

<p>“No argument on that score,” admitted another
of the boys. “Do you suppose any of the poor
chaps can be alive?”</p>

<p>“‘Poor chaps’ is good!” growled Al. “Like
Willum, the coster, I don’t believe in wasting sympathy
on ‘the ’Un.’”</p>

<p>The dashing rain and spray almost blinded at
times the <i>Colodia’s</i> boys, but they searched the
remains of the wrecked dirigible keenly as the
destroyer drew nearer.</p>

<p>Now and then a great wave dashed completely
over the twisted framework and sprawling bag
of silk cloth. And, yes! over several specks that
were apparently lashed to the wreckage. These
specks were bodies of men, whether dead or alive
could not at first be decided with the wind driving
the spindrift head-on.</p>

<p>Commander Lang discussed the situation with
his chief officers amidships. How could they
reach the wreck of the Zeppelin under such
weather conditions as these? Scarcely could a
boat live in such a sea!</p>

<p>“I’ll order no boat’s crew out into such a mess
as that,” said the commander, with a gesture indicating
the gray, leaping waves. “And I hate to
ask for volunteers when those people out there
are what they are. It is hardly possible for the
boys to think of them as human beings. They are
set aside from us; they belong to another race&mdash;a
race that has shown neither mercy nor compassion.”</p>

<p>“It will have to be volunteers, if anybody,”
said one of the other officers. “But I’ve a wife
and children. If I am ordered, I’ll go. But no
volunteering to get those Huns, for me!”</p>

<p>Among the crew the indications were that they
felt about the same as the officers. Said Hans
Hertig:</p>

<p>“Who would volunteer to save them squareheads
yet? Not me!”</p>

<p>“What would they do if they were in our
place?” another of the seamen asked. “They can
watch women and babies drown! Why should we
worry about them?”</p>

<p>“Because we’re Americans, I suppose,” said Al
Torrance gravely. “It’s not done any more&mdash;not
by real folks. Yankees to the rescue, old man!
Somebody’s got to go and pick those Heinies off
like ripe blackberries off the vine.”</p>

<p>But more than a few of the seamen shook their
heads and said “Not me!”</p>

<p>Of course, volunteers had not yet been asked
for, nor did anybody seem to know just what
course should be pursued in striving to rescue the
crew of the Zeppelin. Whistler Morgan and
George Belding, standing well forward, looked
long and earnestly at the imperiled men on the
wreck, then they looked into each other’s faces.</p>

<p>“What do you think?” Belding asked, his lips
making no sound that Phil Morgan could hear,
but his words easily read by Whistler.</p>

<p>“If the <i>Colodia</i> shoots beyond the wreck?”
asked Whistler, moving his lips in the same way
so that George could read what he said. “I could
drift down to it with the current.”</p>

<p>“In a boat?” asked Belding doubtfully.</p>

<p>“With life buoys,” Whistler explained.</p>

<p>Belding understood the scheme and nodded.
Whistler said:</p>

<p>“I’ll speak to Mr. MacMasters.”</p>

<p>He went aft immediately to find the ensign.
Finding Belding close at his shoulder, Whistler
said:</p>

<p>“You don’t need to get into this, George. What
would your folks say?”</p>

<p>“Just about what yours will say if you chuck
your life away for the sake of a lot of Heinies,”
returned Belding briefly. “You can’t do it alone.
It will take two of us to fasten each Heinie into
the buoy so he can be dragged back to the ship.”</p>

<p>“You’ve got the right idea,” agreed Phil, and
turned to speak to Mr. MacMasters.</p>

<p>“What do you two chaps want to do&mdash;throw
your lives away for scum like them?” was the
ensign’s first comment upon Whistler’s proposal.</p>

<p>MacMasters had risen from the forecastle himself,
having won his billet by hard work. He was
apt to look upon most things from the sailor’s
standpoint. The crew of the <i>Colodia</i> had already
seen enough of the despicable work of the Hun to
hate almost with the intensity of Willum Johnson.</p>

<p>“They have to be saved, haven’t they?” Whistler
asked quietly and respectfully.</p>

<p>“But why should you do it?” rejoined
MacMasters, who really loved the lad and feared for
his safety. “Those men over there are not worth
it.”</p>

<p>“<i>We</i> are worth it, sir,” put in George Belding
with earnestness. “Phil has the right idea, and
I want to help him. One fellow can’t do it alone,
anyway.”</p>

<p>MacMasters threw up his hands in a helpless
gesture. “Of course,” he grumbled, “I’ll take
your proposal to Commander Lang,” and strode
away toward the bridge.</p>

<p>Whistler’s suggestion was in line with what
the chief officers had already seen must be done.
“If those lads demand the privilege, I will not
stop them,” said the Commander. “They are
both smart and well set-up boys. But I wish some
of the older men had come before them. In a case
of this kind, it’s ‘first come, first served.’ Tell
them to make ready, Mr. MacMasters. And I
adjure you to take care that they have proper
help.”</p>

<p>When Mr. MacMasters brought back the word
Whistler Morgan and George Belding at once
prepared to put their idea into practice. But the
<i>Colodia</i> had yet to steam past the mass of wreckage
that had been the Zeppelin. There were nine
men lashed to the half sunken framework. Feeble
gestures from some of the figures showed they
were alive.</p>

<p>As the destroyer drew so near and the sorry
state of the Germans was made apparent, the
Americans grew silent. There were no more
curses for the Huns. The most bitter suddenly
thought of the castaways in different mood. Those
were dying men lashed there to the sorry wreck
of the Zeppelin.</p>

<p>Word swiftly passed all over the ship that
Morgan and Belding were about to make an attempt
to rescue those of the castaways who were
still alive. Al Torrance came raving to his chum
and wanted to know what it meant&mdash;why he was
left out of it? If Whistler Morgan was going to
risk his “fool neck to rescue a parcel of Huns,
(so he put it) why couldn’t he be in it?”</p>

<p>“You can, old man,” said the wise Whistler.
“You are just the fellow I want to hang on to
the life buoy line and pay out for me. My life
will be in your hands. Catch hold here!”</p>

<p>Al grumbled some, but did as he was bid. Cold
as it was, the two boys making the attempt to
reach the wrecked Zeppelin stripped to their
underclothes. The <i>Colodia</i> had passed the wreck,
and now swerved so that the current would carry
the two venturesome lads straight down upon the
wreck.</p>

<p>The two buoys were flung overboard, and Morgan
and Belding slipped down the ropes and
plunged into the sea. The first shock of it was
tremendous. It seemed as though the water would
freeze the blood in their veins and the marrow in
their bones.</p>

<p>But they cheered each other, each diving and
coming up within the ring of the buoyant life
buoy assigned him. Al and others payed out carefully
but swiftly. All realized how icy the waters
were. This rescue&mdash;if it was to be successful&mdash;must
be made in quick time.</p>

<p>The two rescuers whirled down upon the wreck.
The framework was raised high upon first one
wave and then another. There was danger of its
parting and carrying away the men lashed to it.
Phil Morgan and Belding knew that they had to
do their work swiftly if they would accomplish
the task they had set out upon.</p>


<h2 id='chIX'>CHAPTER IX&mdash;“SCHMARDIE”</h2>


<p>The <i>Colodia</i> was drifting more than a cable’s
length from the wreck of the German airship that
had fallen into the sea. Philip Morgan and George
Belding were some minutes in dropping down to
the wreck, each upborne by his life buoy, the lines
of which were payed out by their comrades on
the destroyer’s deck.</p>

<p>The ropes soon grew very heavy and had the
ship been much further away the two boys would
have found the life rings of little aid to them.
However, when the waves swept them against the
twisted framework of the Zeppelin, they were
still held well above the surface of the sea and
were able to seize parts of the wreckage.</p>

<p>Whistler signaled those on the <i>Colodia</i> to cease
paying out. Then he turned to look up at the
struggling men above his head. George Belding
cried:</p>

<p>“All right, Phil?”</p>

<p>He bawled the query so loud that Whistler
heard him above the noise of the sea and the
creaking of the wreckage.</p>

<p>“Hunky-dory!” he returned. He pointed above,
and Belding could easily read his lips: “Which
of these Heinies shall we get first?”</p>

<p>One man was already letting himself down
toward the rescuers. By the trimming on his uniform
the American boys were positive he was
an officer&mdash;perhaps the commander of the Zeppelin.</p>

<p>“Tell that fellow to pass down those who are
injured,” Whistler yelled so that his friend could
hear him. “I believe he’s going to try to hog
one of these buoys!”</p>

<p>Belding put up a hand to stop the German.
The latter addressed the two American lads in
English.</p>

<p>“I am Herr Hauptman von Hausen. I am in
command. Will your comrades draw me aboard
in the bight of that rope?”</p>

<p>“Not now, mein Herr,” shouted Whistler.
“You’ve got gall to want to leave your comrades
who may be helpless! Get some of them down
here&mdash;and have a care that you do help them, too,
or I’m not so sure that you will ever get to the
destroyer at all!”</p>

<p>“Impudence! I shall report you to your commanding
officer,” declared the Zeppelin’s captain
fiercely.</p>

<p>“Believe me!” exclaimed Whistler, “that will
do you a lot of good. Look out for this fellow,
George! Let’s see that he is hauled in last just
for that.”</p>

<p>“I’m with you,” agreed the other American.
“Can you reach that young chap just above your
head? I believe he’s got a broken arm.”</p>

<p>Whistler had managed to climb out of the sea
and stood upon one stay, clinging to another.
Now he reached up to aid the fellow George Belding
had spoken of. The German was no older
than the lads from the destroyer&mdash;a thin, pale
fellow, his face drawn with pain, and his left
arm strapped clumsily to his side.</p>

<p>“He’s got a broken arm, all right,” Whistler
shouted. “When I pass him down, George, do
you unbuckle his belt and fasten him with it to
the ring. Then he won’t be swept away, even if
he has but one hand to cling with. All ready?”</p>

<p>“Here, you!” exclaimed Belding, addressing
the “Herr Hauptmann” in no respectful tone.
“Lend a hand, will you? If you don’t I’ll cut you
adrift.”</p>

<p>Belding had out his knife to cut a lashing and
he looked as though he would carry out his threat.
The Zeppelin commander slid down the stay and
aided in lowering the younger German out of the
wreck.</p>

<p>In five minutes they had him lashed as Whistler
suggested to the life buoy, and the young German
was on his way to the destroyer. A third inflated
ring had been floated down to the tangle of débris
drifting in the rising sea. Both Morgan and
Belding were aware that they must work rapidly
if they would save those of the Germans who were
still alive. The wreckage was shifting from moment
to moment. One body suddenly plunged
beneath the tossing waves, but the Americans
knew that the victim was already dead.</p>

<p>The men beside the captain had cut themselves
loose and crawled down to the level of the sea.
These two the rescuers sent away clinging to one
of the inflated rings, for they could both handle
themselves pretty well. But they kept Commander
von Hausen until the first life buoy was emptied
and was sent back again,</p>

<p>The four bodies left above were not all of live
men; the boys were sure of that. And when they
had got the first quartette of castaways started
for the destroyer, Belding climbed up to cut away
the nearest man. He was very weak, and after he
was loosened from the stays he proved to be
unable to help himself.</p>

<p>The situation of the two boys from the destroyer
was now becoming very precarious indeed.
They could not hang on here for much longer
themselves.</p>

<p>“One of us will have to go back with this fellow,”
declared Belding. “You take him, Phil.
I am in better shape than you are.”</p>

<p>“Who told you so?” demanded the Seacove
boy. “You take him. I’ll get that other fellow
up there and follow you. Al and the others are
floating another buoy down to us.”</p>

<p>“No,” said Belding. “I’ll lash this fellow here
and he’ll have to take his chance until we get his
mate. Those two beyond are dead, aren’t they?”</p>

<p>“Sure,” returned Whistler. “Poor things!
Just think of their hanging on here for so long.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes,” growled Belding, but with some
scorn. “You can see just how much good it’s
done that captain.”</p>

<p>They were close together or they could not
have heard each other speak. The wind shrieked
and the waves roared, making a chorus of sounds
that well nigh drowned their voices.</p>

<p>With great difficulty they brought the second
man down. Then, having lashed each sufferer
to a life buoy, Whistler Morgan and Belding set
out to swim beside them to the destroyer.</p>

<p>The waves were much higher now and the two
lads were not so strong as when they had come
out to the Zeppelin. They never could have
reached the <i>Colodia</i> without help, and, withal,
they were pretty well exhausted when they were
drawn to the side of the pitching destroyer.</p>

<p>Cheers greeted them. The crew was generous
always in acknowledging the individual bravery
of its members. However, when it was all over
and Phil and Belding had been treated by the
doctor and were between blankets, Frenchy was
inclined to “josh” a little.</p>

<p>“By St. Patrick’s piper that played the last
snake out of Ireland!” he cried, “it will keep you
broke for polish to shine up all your medals,
Whistler. If Commander Lang reports this to
the port admiral, you and Belding will get some
junk to wear on the proud young chests of yez!
And there’s the medal ye got, Whistler, for grapplin’
wid the depth bomb and sub chaser Three
Eights!”</p>

<p>Whistler tossed a boot at his tormentor’s head,
but Frenchy dodged it and escaped from the sick
bay where the doctor had ordered Morgan and
Belding to remain for the time being. They were
kept there with the German lad with the broken
arm until the next morning, when the friends
were ordered to appear before Commander Lang.
The latter said with a quizzical smile:</p>

<p>“I hear a bad report of you young chaps on
one point. The Herr Hauptman Frederich Wilhelm
von Hausen says you were not sufficiently
respectful to him.”</p>

<p>“We weren’t, I guess,” admitted George Belding.
“How about it, Phil?”</p>

<p>“I am afraid we did not pay sufficient attention
to his High Mightiness, sir,” rejoined Morgan.
“You see, sir, we sent the wounded boy
over first. That captain was in too big a hurry.”</p>

<p>“Yes. Well,” drawled the commander, “I suppose
I shall have to pass this complaint along to
the proper authorities. But I believe I can congratulate
you two lads on drawing down the
United States gold life saving medal for your act.</p>

<p>“You, Belding, have made an excellent mark
for yourself on joining the <i>Colodia</i>. We already
knew what sort of metal Morgan was built of.
Thank you, my lads! If the surgeon gives you a
true bill, you may turn to with your watches.”</p>

<p>The boys saluted and departed for their stations.
The destroyer was making for port and
the headlands were visible. But the storm had
not blown over and the ship was rolling forty-five
to fifty degrees. If an ordinary merchant ship
rolls forty degrees her crew think that the end
has come and they will be wrecked; forty degrees
is ordinary for a destroyer to roll in the sea.
Often moving about the <i>Colodia</i> was almost like
climbing a sheer wall.</p>

<p>The two boys who had done so brave an act
the day before were commended on all sides; but
their mates’ approbation took the form of good
natured joking, for which both Morgan and Belding
were thankful.</p>

<p>They heard much comment regarding the German
captives from the other members of the
crew. Especially did they learn certain things
about the youth with the broken arm whom they
had first sent off to the destroyer from the wreck
of the Zeppelin.</p>

<p>He was named Franz Eberhardt, and he was
in the sick bay instead of being confined with the
other prisoners. Hear Hans Hertig rail about
him:</p>

<p>“That feller is a schmardie&mdash;one o’ them German
schmardies what you hear about. I would
like to have him workin’ on this <i>Colodia</i>. We
would work some of the schmardness out of him
yet.”</p>

<p>“What’s the matter with him, Boatswain?” demanded
Al Torrance.</p>

<p>“Huh! He tells me the Germans ain’t begun
to fight yet! Sure! They will lick all the world&mdash;let
him tell it. He iss one Prussian.”</p>

<p>Phil Morgan got a chance to go down to the
sick bay and interview the young prisoner. The
latter knew that Morgan was one of those who
had rescued him and his mates; but there was a
certain arrogance about his manner and speech
that was not likely to make him friends among
his captors.</p>

<p>“Aren’t you worried about your position at
all?” asked Whistler, when they had talked for
some time.</p>

<p>“Me?” repeated the German in very good English.
“Why should I fear? I am an Eberhardt.
My uncle lived long in England and has friends
there. I shall make friends. The English do
not dare treat us Germans badly, for they know
that in the end they will be beaten and we will
punish them severely if they treat prisoners unkindly.
Oh, yes!”</p>

<p>“Say!” drawled Whistler, “where do you get
that stuff? You must have caught it from that
von Hausen. He wanted to push you out of the
way and take your place in the life buoy.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” admitted the German youth simply.
“He is <i>Hauptman</i>. Why not?”</p>

<p>“Good-<i>night</i>!” growled Whistler. “Our officers
don’t do that. They would consider it beneath
them to be saved before their crew.”</p>

<p>Eberhardt, who was sitting up, shrugged his
shoulders. “Yes?” he repeated. “But of course,
they are not <i>gnädige Herren</i>.”</p>

<p>“That means ‘noble sirs’,” scoffed Whistler.
“No, thank heaven, we do not have such a caste
as that in America!”</p>

<p>“You have some very rich men&mdash;very rich. I
have heard my cousin Emil say. He knows many
of them. Many are from German blood. Of
course, <i>when</i> we finish the war, they will create
a caste, as you call it, in your United States.
Cousin Emil says&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Who is your Cousin Emil?” demanded Phil
Morgan more amused than angered after all,
by this kind of talk. “Is he in the States now?”</p>

<p>“Not yet,” said young Eberhardt, slyly looking
at his inquisitor. “But he is going.”</p>

<p>“Before the war ends? Not much chance of
that.”</p>

<p>“Poof!” rejoined the German youth. “You
cannot stop Emil. What he wants to do, he does.
He is a great man. He has been decorated by the
Emperor.”</p>

<p>“What department does he fight in?”</p>

<p>“Ah, he is greater than a fighter,” said young
Eberhardt, shaking his head. “He goes hither
and yon&mdash;where he chooses. In France, England,
Italy, and now to your country, America.”</p>

<p>“A spy?” growled Morgan.</p>

<p>“Call him as you like. Cousin Emil is a wonderful
man. Why, to fly from our bases in Belgium
to this England is nothing to Cousin Emil.
He has so traveled a dozen times. But this was
my first trip.”</p>

<p>“You were not traveling with your cousin in
that Zep, were you?”</p>

<p>“Ah, no. You say our sister <i>Luftshiff</i>&mdash;she
is fallen?”</p>

<p>“Smashed all to pieces,” declared Whistler with
satisfaction. “And her crew prisoners&mdash;all but
one.”</p>

<p>“Ah!” breathed Eberhardt, slyly smiling again.
“And he who escaped?”</p>

<p>“What do you know about him?” asked
Whistler in surprise. “That fellow is a spy I
bet! He was not a regular member of the Zep’s
crew.”</p>

<p>“No? You saw him?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Is he a man with a very sharp eye, a moustache
like our Emperor, a tiny beard here?”
touching his lower lip.</p>

<p>“That’s the fellow!” cried Whistler. “Do you
mean to say he is your cousin Emil, and a spy?”</p>

<p>“Oh, no, my friend,” chuckled the “schmardie.”
“Oh, no. I do not say that. I merely say that
man with the little beard on his lip&mdash;a goatee,
do you call it?&mdash;plays the cornet. You know,
most cornet players wear the little goatee, isn’t
it so?”</p>

<p>Eberhardt laughed again and wagged his head,
refusing to say more. As for thanking Whistler
for what he and Belding had done toward saving
his life, such a thought never seemed to enter
the German youth’s mind.</p>


<h2 id='chX'>CHAPTER X&mdash;THE TERROR OF THE SEAS</h2>


<p>Phil Morgan, on thinking over the conversation
with Franz Eberhardt, was not at all sure
that he should have discussed the wreck of the
other Zeppelin so freely with the prisoner. Yet
Eberhardt was a prisoner, and was not likely to
be in a position to use any information he might
have gained to benefit his nation for a long time
to come. If Eberhardt’s cousin was a spy, perhaps
this young chap was one too.</p>

<p>The hint Franz had dropped about the man
who had escaped from the Zeppelin that had
been brought down on land, Whistler passed on,
through the proper channels, to the commander
of the destroyer. He could do no more than that.
Possibly the man who had tied up George Belding
and escaped in the latter’s clothes, might be the
“Cousin Emil” of whom Franz was so proud.</p>

<p>The <i>Colodia</i> steamed into the port at which she
was stationed to find the convoy and most of the
naval vessels cleared out to accompany the merchant
craft. The American destroyer would be
held for any emergency call and there would be
no present shore leave for her crew.</p>

<p>Phil received a long letter, one long delayed,
from his sister Alice. The whole story of how
the Beldings had come to invite Whistler’s two
sisters to accompany them to Bahia was here set
forth, and the young fellow’s mind was much
relieved when Alice assured him that even the
suggestion of the voyage had so delighted Phoebe
that she already showed improvement in her
health.</p>

<p>Kind words from many neighbors and friends
were included in the letter for the other Seacove
boys. Of course, Alice did not know at the time
of writing that George Belding was booked for
a billet on the <i>Colodia</i>, too, or she would have
sent a message to him.</p>

<p>No thought that the <i>Redbird</i> might come to
grief on her voyage to the South American port
seemed to trouble Alice Morgan’s mind when she
wrote to her brother. At that time it was thought
all German raiders and U-boats were driven from
the Western Atlantic waters.</p>

<p>However that might be, the Huns were active
enough in the waters through which the <i>Colodia</i>
plied. It was only two days after Whistler and
George Belding had saved the living remainder
of the Zeppelin crew when an S O S call was
picked up by the port wireless station and transmitted
to the destroyer. It was possible that the
ship in peril was too far away for the <i>Colodia</i>
to be of service; nevertheless she started out of
the harbor within ten minutes of the reception of
the aero plea for help.</p>

<p>The weather was rough, and the ship barely
dropped the headlands below the horizon at sunset.
They were bound, doubtless, on a useless
night trip. And yet, such ventures were a part
of the work of the destroyers and must be expected
by their crews.</p>

<p>When night had fallen there was only a pale
radiance resting on the sea while broken wind
clouds drove athwart a gray and dreary sky. No
stars were visible. From behind the weather
screen of the bridge, where the two watch officers
were stationed, nothing could be seen ahead
but the phosphorescent flash of waves otherwise
as black as ink. These flashes, where the waves
broke at their crests, decreased rather than aided
the powers of vision.</p>

<p>The crew of the <i>Colodia</i> were by this time so
well used to their work that there were few
false alarms as the ship tore on through the dark
seas. Such errands as this were part of the expectation&mdash;almost
of routine. The destroyers at
night fairly “smelled” their way from point to
point.</p>

<p>Now and then a porpoise shot straight toward
the <i>Colodia</i>, leaving a sparkling wake so like that
of a torpedo that the lookout might be excused
for giving a mistaken warning. But the men
knew the real thing now, and the gunners did not
bang away at fish or floating débris as they had
in the beginning.</p>

<p>“Why, even Isa Bopp has not for a long time
raised a flivver,” said Al Torrance, discussing
this matter with George Belding and Whistler.
“And Ikey has stopped straining his eyes when
he’s off duty. One time he would have hollered
‘wolf’ if he’d seen a dill pickle floating three hundred
yards off our weather bow.”</p>

<p>“That’s all right,” said Whistler. “But Ikey
won the first gold piece for sighting a German
sub when he first went to sea on this old knife-blade.
He’s got eyes for something besides dill
pickles, has Ikey.”</p>

<p>The crackling radio was intercepting messages
from other ships&mdash;all kinds of ships. The
S O S call was no longer being repeated; but the
<i>Colodia’s</i> officers had learned the position of the
vessel that called for help at the start, and the
destroyer did not swerve from her course. She
roared on through the dark sea directly for the
spot indicated.</p>

<p>“There’s nothing fancy in this job, George,”
Phil Morgan said to their new chum. “Nothing
like a good, slap-dash battle with the Hun fleet,
such as we had a few weeks ago, or even chasing
a Hun raider out of Zeebrugge, or Kiel. But the
old <i>Colodia</i> has had ‘well done’ signaled her by the
fleet admiral more than once.”</p>

<p>“You bet!” Al Torrance put in. “We’ve sunk
more than one of the U-boats. We’re one of
‘the terrors of the sea,’ boy&mdash;like the song tells
about. That is what they call our flotilla.”</p>

<p>“Ah! I’ve heard all that before,” Belding said,
in some disgust. “I want to see action!”</p>

<p>As it chanced, he saw action on this very cruise.
First, however, came the conclusion of the incident
that had brought them out of port, chasing
a phantom S O S.</p>

<p>A light burning low on the water was spied
about ten o’clock. It could be nothing but an
open boat, and the <i>Colodia’s</i> prow was turned
more directly toward it. The sea was really too
rough for a submarine to be awash, yet the Huns
had been known to linger in the vicinity of their
victims so as to catch the rescuing vessel unaware.
A sharp lookout was maintained as the <i>Colodia</i>
steamed onward.</p>

<p>The torch in the open boat flared and smoked,
while the boat pitched and tossed&mdash;seemingly
scarcely under command of its crew. There was
no sign of any other craft in the vicinity. The
signal from the attacked ship having stopped
hours before, without much doubt she had sunk.</p>

<p>And but one boat remained!</p>

<p>The destroyer sped down within hailing
distance of the open boat, burning signals of her
own meanwhile. Getting on the weather quarter
of the castaways, the latter were ordered to pull
to the <i>Colodia</i>.</p>

<p>The boat held only nineteen survivors of the
<i>Newcastle Boy</i>, a collier that had been torpedoed
by a submarine. There had been a second boat,
and both had been shelled after the collier sank,
and the mate, who was in command of these
rescued castaways, feared his captain’s boat was
utterly lost. Had the sea not been so rough, he
said, the Germans would have succeeded in sinking
his boat, too.</p>

<p>Whistler was on duty amidships and he overheard
much of the report made by the collier’s
mate to Lieutenant Commander Lang and the
conversation among the officers thereon.</p>

<p>He was particularly impressed by the inquiries
the destroyer’s commander made regarding the
nature of the attack, the type of U-boat that did
the deed, and similar details.</p>

<p>A close track was kept of all these submarine
attacks. The methods of certain submarine commanders
could usually be traced. These reports
were kept by the British Admiralty and were
intended, at the end of the war, to assist in identifying
U-boat commanders who had committed
atrocities. Those men should, in the end, not
escape punishment for their horrid crimes.</p>

<p>This attack upon the <i>Newcastle Boy</i> had been
particularly brutal. There were four wounded
men in the mate’s boat. If the captain’s boat
were lost, the missing would total twenty-six.</p>

<p>The <i>Colodia</i>, swinging in wide circles through
the rough sea, remained near the scene of the
catastrophe until morning. They discovered no
trace of the sunken ship, although the mate declared
she had gone down within a mile of the
spot where the destroyer had picked up the survivors.</p>

<p>But at daybreak the watchful lookouts did spy
a broken oar and part of the bow of the captain’s
lifeboat&mdash;its air-compartment keeping it afloat.
No human being was there to be seen, and the conclusion
was unescapable that the Hun had done
his best to “sink without trace” another helpless
boat’s crew.</p>

<p>It was mid-afternoon, however, before the
<i>Colodia</i> left the vicinity of the tragedy. There
was a desire in the hearts of her crew and officers
to sight the submarine that had committed this
atrocity.</p>

<p>Finally, however, the American naval vessel
was swung about for port and began to pick up
speed. These destroyers never seem to go anywhere
at an easy pace; they are always “rushed”
in their schedule.</p>

<p>Having given up hope of catching the particular
submarine that had sunk the <i>Newcastle Boy</i>, the
<i>Colodia’s</i> lookouts did not, however, fail to watch
for other submersibles. Men stationed in the
tops, on the bridge, and in both bow and stern,
trained keen eyes upon the surrounding sea as
the destroyer dashed on her way.</p>

<p>Ikey Rosenmeyer and his special chum, Frenchy
Donahue, were in the bows on watch. Even those
two “gabbers,” as Al Torrance called them, knew
enough to keep their tongues still while on duty;
and nobody on the destroyer had keener vision
than Ikey and Frenchy.</p>

<p>Almost together the two hailed the bridge:</p>

<p>“Off the port bow, sir!” while Ikey added
“Starboard your helm!”</p>

<p>A great cry went up from amidships. The
<i>Colodia</i> escaped the object just beneath the surface
by scarcely a boat’s length. Men sprang
to the depth-bomb arms and the crews to their
guns.</p>

<p>But it was not a submarine. A great wave
caused by the swift shifting of the <i>Colodia’s</i> helm,
brought the object almost to the surface.</p>

<p>“A mine!” roared the crew.</p>

<p>The destroyer’s speed was slackened instantly.
She swung broadside to the menace. A few
snappy commands, and two of the deck guns
roared.</p>

<p>Instantly a geyser of water and smoke rose
from the sea. The explosion of the mine could
have been seen for many miles. Had the destroyer
collided with it&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>“We’d have gone to Davy Jones’ locker, sure
enough, fellows,” said Al Torrance. “Those
mines the Huns are sowing through these seas
now would blow up the Brooklyn Bridge. Suppose
the <i>Leviathan</i>, troop ship, scraped her keel
on that thing?”</p>

<p>There was much discussion all over the destroyer
about the mine. It suggested that the
submarine that had sunk the <i>Newcastle Boy</i> might
be a mine-sower. That fact would help identify
the submarine, for all types of German submersibles
are not fitted with mine wells.</p>

<p>“You see how it is, George,” said Phil Morgan
to their new chum. “These seas around here are
just as safe as a powder factory&mdash;just about!
How does it make you feel?”</p>

<p>“Pshaw!” returned Belding, “didn’t I tell you
we almost caught a sub when I was out on the
<i>Sirius</i>? I don’t believe the Heinies have got so
many of ’em, after all.”</p>

<p>“Never you mind,” said Whistler. “They’ve
got enough if they have but one, believe me!
Just think how we fellows used to gas about submarines
and all that. Before the war, I mean!
We never dreamed any country would use them
as the Germans have.”</p>

<p>The tone of the whole crew after the narrow
escape from the mine was intense. They were on
the lookout for almost anything to happen. Before
mid-afternoon, while still out of sight of
land, the top hailed the deck officers.</p>

<p>“Steamer in sight, sir!”</p>

<p>The position and course of the stranger was
given, and immediately everybody who had
glasses turned them in the indicated direction.
The destroyer’s course was changed a trifle, for
everything that floated on the sea was examined
by the Allied patrol.</p>

<p>Soon the high, rusted sides of an ancient tramp
steamship hove into the view of all. She was a
two-stack steamer, and despite her evident age
and frowsiness she was making good time toward
the Thames.</p>

<p>“Taking a chance,” Ensign MacMasters said to
Whistler and his friends. “That is what she is
doing. She’s not even camouflaged. Her owner
has found some daredevil fellows to run her and
will make a fortune in a single voyage&mdash;or lose
the ship, one or the other. Great gamblers, some
of these old ship owners.”</p>

<p>“Gamblers with men’s lives,” said George
Belding. “I should know. My father is in the
business; but he does not take such chances as
that.”</p>

<p>“Not even with the <i>Redbird</i>?” whispered
Whistler anxiously. “I don’t know about Phoebe
and Alice sailing on her.”</p>

<p>“Oh, pshaw! there’s no danger over yonder,”
declared George. “We’ve driven all the Huns
from the Western Atlantic.”</p>

<p>“Hope so,” returned Whistler.</p>

<p>Just then a cry rose from some of the men on
deck. The destroyer was near enough to the tramp
steamship now to observe what went on aboard of
her. They saw men running about her deck.
Then followed the “Bang! Bang! Bang!” of her
deck guns.</p>

<p>The guns were aimed for the far side of the
tramp&mdash;the object they were aiming at being out
of sight. But the destroyer’s crew knew what
that fusillade meant.</p>

<p>“A sub! She’s got a sub under her guns!” was
the yell that rose all over the <i>Colodia</i>.</p>

<p>Swift orders from the bridge and instantly the
destroyer shot ahead like a mettlesome horse
under spur and whip.</p>


<h2 id='chXI'>CHAPTER XI&mdash;ACTION</h2>


<p>If action was what George Belding craved,
he was getting it. Everybody aboard the United
States destroyer <i>Colodia</i> was on the alert as the
craft leaped ahead to full speed for the spot
where the rusty-sided tramp steamship was popping
away with her deck guns at some object as
yet not in view from the destroyer.</p>

<p>The merchant ship was being conned on a
zig-zag course, evidently in an attempt to dodge an
expected torpedo. Her hull hid whatever she
was shooting at from the crew of the <i>Colodia</i>;
but the latter did not doubt the nature of the big
ship’s erratic course.</p>

<p>At top speed the <i>Colodia</i> rushed to the fray,
and on suddenly rounding the stern of the tramp,
a great shout rose from the boys ranged along
the destroyer’s rail:</p>

<p>“There she is!”</p>

<p>The cry was drowned by the salvo of guns
discharged at the conning tower of the German
submersible not more than a thousand yards from
the tramp ship. The position of the German
craft had been excellent at first for a shot at the
merchant vessel; but her first torpedo had evidently
missed its objective. Now with the destroyer
in view, the Hun let drive a second missile
and then began to submerge.</p>

<p>The torpedo’s wake could be seen by the lookouts
on the <i>Colodia</i> the instant it left its tube.
The tramp vessel evaded the explosive; but the
destroyer was directly in the torpedo’s path.</p>

<p>There was real danger at this moment. Quickly
swerved as she might be, it was not at all sure
that the <i>Colodia</i> could escape the torpedo. Every
man and boy aboard was at his station; among
them Al Torrance was placed at the starboard
rail. He was armed, like many of his mates, with
a rifle.</p>

<p>As the destroyer shot across the path of the
torpedo Torry fitted the butt of his rifle into the
hollow of his shoulder, huddled his cheek against
the stock, and brought the cross-sights of the
rifle full upon the sharklike projectile.</p>

<p>The rifle report was almost instantaneous with
the roar of the torpedo. The latter blew up not
twenty yards from the destroyer’s rail!</p>

<p>“Hi! Hi! Hi!” yelled the mates of the keen-sighted
Torrance.</p>

<p>“Well done!” called the officer of the watch
through his megaphone. “Well done, Torrance!”</p>

<p>The whole crew cheered again, and Al’s flaming
face acknowledged their appreciation. Mr. MacMasters
came quickly to wring the lad’s hand in
appreciation.</p>

<p>“Good for you, Torrance,” he said. “Your
name goes down on the log for that.”</p>

<p>“Aw, she wouldn’t have hit us anyway,” said
Al, quite overcome by so much praise.</p>

<p>“Never mind. It showed accurate marksmanship
and good work, too. Those autoprojectiles
are dangerous to leave drifting about the seas.
You get a good mark, my boy.”</p>

<p>Meanwhile the <i>Colodia</i>, swerving not a hair
from her course, reached and overran the spot
where the submersible had sunk. The order rang
out and the depth bomb was dropped. Then the
destroyer scurried out of the way to escape the
effect of the deep-down explosion.</p>

<p>Up from the depths rose a mound of muddy
water. It rose twenty feet above the surface, and
the spray shot twice as high. The thundering explosion
shook the running destroyer in every part.
The effect of the discharge upon what was under
the sea must have been terrible.</p>

<p>Half a mile away the <i>Colodia</i> swerved and
circled, to pass again over the spot where the
bomb had been dropped. The boys leaned over
the rails to watch for anything in the water that
might prove that the submarine had been wrecked.
There was not a bit of wreckage; but suddenly
Ikey Rosenmeyer shrieked:</p>

<p>“Oil! Oil! Oh, bully! Oil!”</p>

<p>A roar of other voices took up the cry. Great
bubbles of oil rose to the surface. The <i>Colodia</i>
passed over a regular “slick” of fluid that could
mean nothing but that the tanks of the submersible
had been ripped open by the explosion
of the depth bomb.</p>

<p>Morgan found George Belding standing beside
him and looking back at the oil-streaked waves
with a very serious visage.</p>

<p>“What’s on your mind?” asked the Seacove
lad.</p>

<p>“It seems terrible, doesn’t it, Phil?” said Belding.
“All those fellows! Gone like <i>that</i>!” and he
snapped his fingers.</p>

<p>“Well,” returned Whistler, “you wanted
action, didn’t you? Now I guess you’ve had
enough for a while.”</p>

<p>“I believe you,” agreed his friend solemnly.</p>

<p>But the work and life of the boys on the destroyer
was not altogether made up of such scenes
and incidents as these that have been related. Just
at this time the troop ships were coming across
from America in great convoys and the <i>Colodia</i>
sometimes had less than half a day in port between
trips. Four or five hours ashore in the
English port, or at Brest where the greater
number of ships from America landed their freight
and human cargoes, was the utmost freedom that
the Navy Boys and their mates secured.</p>

<p>There were extra calls, now and then, like these
which have been related herein. When an S O S
call is picked up by shore or ship radio, every
Naval vessel within reach is sure to make for the
point of peril.</p>

<p>The life was not altogether exciting, however,
for there were many days of tedious watching
and waiting in which it seemed that the Hun
boats had all scurried back to their bases and the
patrols scarcely raised a porpoise, much less one
of the “steel sharks of the sea.”</p>

<p>At Brest, well along in the month following
the introduction of George Belding to the <i>Colodia</i>,
the young fellow from New York got a cablegram
from his father mentioning the date of the
<i>Redbird’s</i> sailing for Bahia with his own family
and Philip Morgan’s sisters aboard.</p>

<p>Whether the treasure of gold coin was to be
part of the ship’s burthen or not, the cablegram
did not state. George had written his father
about his lost letters and papers and of the probability
that the knowledge of the treasure would
reach those Germans who would consider the ship
bound for South America, and all she carried,
their legitimate prey.</p>

<p>If information of the treasure of gold coin had
been sent by the spy from the Zeppelin to his
associates in the United States, there might be
already afoot a plot to get possession of Mr.
Belding’s gold. The boys of the <i>Colodia</i> had not
heard of the capture of the spy who had disappeared
in George Belding’s uniform. Much as
they had inquired in England, they had been able
to learn absolutely nothing.</p>

<p>Phil Morgan had even been to see Franz Eberhardt
at the port hospital where the young German
was confined while his arm was being skilfully
treated by the English surgeons. Later the
German youth had been taken to an internment
camp in one of the back shires. Before he had
gone Whistler had tried to get him to talk again
about “Cousin Emil.” But Franz had become
wary.</p>

<p>He was no longer acting “the schmardie,” as
Hans Hertig had called him. He had begun to
see something of England and had learned something
of the character of the English. To be a
prisoner, and well treated as he was, was a much
more serious situation than had at first appeared.</p>

<p>But he refused to say anything at all of Cousin
Emil. Whether it really was Franz Eberhardt’s
cousin with whom the Navy Boys and “Willum”
Johnson had had their adventure, the fact remained
that as far as the boys knew, a German
spy was at large in England, And he had
information in his possession that might possibly injure
Mr. Belding and his affairs.</p>

<p>The Seacove boys were all now interested in
the sailing of the <i>Redbird</i>. If Whistler’s two
sisters alone had been sailing for Bahia the others
would have felt a personal anxiety in the matter.</p>

<p>“Wish the old <i>Colodia</i> was going to convoy
that <i>Redbird</i>,” Al Torrance said. “Eh, fellows?”</p>

<p>“By St. Patrick’s piper that played the last
snake out of Ireland!” declared Frenchy Donahue,
“’twould be the foinest of luck if she was.”</p>

<p>“Oi! oi! Ain’t it so?” murmured Ikey. “And
that Alice Morgan such a pretty girl! I hope that
<i>Redbird</i> gets to Bahia safe.”</p>

<p>“As far as we can hear,” said Whistler cheerfully,
“there are neither submarines nor raiders
now in the Western Atlantic. They seem to have
been chased out, boys.”</p>

<p>This supposition, however, did not prove to be
founded on fact; for on the very next occasion
that the <i>Colodia</i> was in the French port, Brest,
there was much excitement regarding a new German
raider reported to have got out of Zeebrugge
and run to the southward, doing damage on small
craft along the French coast. This was before
the British Captain Carpenter with the <i>Vindictive</i>
bottled up that outlet of German ships.</p>

<p>Some denied that it was a raider at all, but a
big, new submarine that was built with
upperworks to look like a steam carrier when she was
on the surface. However, she had a name, it
being the <i>Sea Pigeon</i>, instead of a letter and number.
The whole fleet of destroyers was soon on
the lookout for this strange vessel, and the American
commanders offered liberal rewards to the
owners of the sharp eyes who first spotted the new
Hun terror of the seas.</p>

<p>The <i>Colodia</i> went to sea to meet a new convoy
from America, “all set” as the boys said, to make
a killing if they ran across the <i>Sea Pigeon</i>.</p>

<p>“Well, we got the <i>Graf von Posen</i>,” Ikey
Rosenmeyer said, with cheerful optimism, “so
why not this here <i>Pigeon</i> ship? We’re the boys
that bring home the bacon, aren’t we?”</p>

<p>“Aw, Ikey!” groaned Frenchy Donahue. “Can’t
you ever forget you were brought up in a delicatessen
shop? ‘Bring home the bacon,’ indade!”</p>


<h2 id='chXII'>CHAPTER XII&mdash;WIRELESS WHISPERS</h2>


<p>On duty with the morning watch, just after
sick call at half past eight, Phil Morgan and
George Belding met right abaft the radio station.
There was half an hour or so before the divisions
would be piped to fall in for muster and
inspection, and the two friends could chat a
little.</p>

<p>“Well, the folks are on the sea, as we are, Phil,
if the <i>Redbird</i> sailed as per schedule,” Belding
said.</p>

<p>“I sha’n’t feel really happy till we hear they
are at Bahia,” responded Whistler, shaking his
head.</p>

<p>“Right-o! But the <i>Redbird</i> is a fine ship, and
just as safe as a house.”</p>

<p>“But she’s a sailing ship&mdash;and slow.”</p>

<p>“Not so slow, if anybody should ask you,”
returned Belding smiling.</p>

<p>“A four-master?”</p>

<p>“And square rigged. A real ship. No
schooner-rig, or half-and-half. Captain Jim Lowder
thinks she is the finest thing afloat. Of course,
she is thirty years old; but she was built to last.
Regular passenger sailing ship, with a round-the-world
record that would make the British tea
ships sit up and take notice. Her cabin finished
in mahogany, staterooms in white enamel&mdash;simply
fine!”</p>

<p>“I didn’t know they had such sailing ships,”
said Whistler in wonder.</p>

<p>“Oh, there are a few left. The Huns haven’t
sunk them all. Nor have the steam craft put
such as the <i>Redbird</i> out of commission. You
couldn’t get Captain Jim Lowder to take out a
steam vessel. He abominates the ‘iron pots,’ as
he calls the steam freighters.</p>

<p>“But sailing ships like the <i>Redbird</i> are kept
out of the European trade if possible. Even Captain
Lowder must admit that a sailing ship is not
in the game of fighting subs.”</p>

<p>“That is the way I feel. Wish your folks and
mine were going south on a steamer, George.”</p>

<p>“No fear. They will be all right,” was Belding’s
reassuring reply.</p>

<p>“Just the same I’d feel a lot better if all the
Hun subs and raiders were bottled up at their
bases.”</p>

<p>“By the way,” said Belding, “what do you
think of this <i>Sea Pigeon</i> we hear so much talk
about? Think there is such a craft?”</p>

<p>“Why not? We know that some kind of an
enemy vessel slipped along south and evaded our
patrol, leaving a trail of sunken and torpedoed
ships behind her.”</p>

<p>“But a huge submarine, with superstructure
and all&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“<i>That</i> is only a guess,” laughed Whistler. “Personally,
I believe this <i>Sea Pigeon</i> is a raider and
no submarine at all. A submarine of the size
reported would use up a lot of petrol.”</p>

<p>“That’s all right,” said Belding quickly. “She
could get supplies down along the Spanish coast.
There are plenty of people that way friendly to
the Germans.”</p>

<p>At the moment they heard the sudden chatter
of the radio instrument. Belding turned instantly
to put his head into the little room. The operator
smiled and nodded to him.</p>

<p>“Something doing,” he muttered. “One of you
chaps want to take this message to the com?”</p>

<p>“Let’s have it,” said Whistler, quickly, holding
out his hand.</p>

<p>“I’d like to put on that harness myself,” said
Belding. “We had a wireless on the roof of our
house in New York before the war. Government
made us wreck it.”</p>

<p>“Jinks!” exclaimed Whistler, waiting for the
operator to write out the message received and
slip it into an envelope. “Do <i>you</i> know how to
work one of these things, George?”</p>

<p>“I know something about it,” admitted Belding.
“What’s it all about?” he asked the operator.</p>

<p>“Orders for us,” said the man. “You’ll know
soon enough. We’re due for new cruising
grounds, boys. But keep your tongues still till
the com eases the information to all hands.”</p>

<p>He had finished the receipt and “repeat” of the
message. Whistler took the envelope and sprang
away with it to the commander’s quarters.</p>

<p>He knew by the expression on Mr. Lang’s face
when he scanned the message that there was
something big in view. The commanding officer
of the <i>Colodia</i> swiftly wrote a reply and gave it
to Whistler for the radio man. Belding was still
hanging about the wireless room. His face was
flushed and his eyes shone.</p>

<p>“Do you know what it is all about, Phil?” he
whispered.</p>

<p>“Not a thing. But the Old Man,” said Whistler,
“is some excited.”</p>

<p>Rumor that changed orders had reached the
<i>Colodia</i> spread abroad before muster and inspection.
The usual physical drills were gone
through while the boys’ minds were on tiptoe.
Even the order at four bells to relieve the wheel
and lookout startled the crew, so expectant were
they.</p>

<p>But nothing happened until just before retreat
from drill at eleven-thirty. Commander Lang
then made his appearance. He went to the quarter
and addressed the crew.</p>

<p>“We have been honored by an order to go freelancing
after a suspected vessel, supposed to be
a German raider, last and recently reported to
be off the Azores,” he said. “Because we were
successful some months ago in taking the <i>Graf
von Posen</i>, we are assigned to this work.”</p>

<p>At this point the crew broke into cheers, and
with a smile the commanding officer waved his
hand for the boatswain’s mates to pipe retreat.</p>

<p>The <i>Colodia</i> was at this time sailing within
sight of half a dozen other destroyers bound out
to pick up the expected convoy. After a little
her wireless crackled a curt “good-bye” to her
companions, and the <i>Colodia</i> changed her course
for a more southerly one.</p>

<p>The chances, for and against, of overhauling
the <i>Sea Pigeon</i> were volubly discussed, from the
commander’s offices to the galley, and everybody,
including the highest officer and the most humble
steward’s boy, had a vital interest in the destroyer’s
objective.</p>

<p>To attempt to chase a ship like this German
raider about the ocean was a most uncertain task.</p>

<p>“But if the luck of the <i>Colodia</i> runs true to
form,” Al Torrance expressed it, “we shall turn
the trick.”</p>

<p>“That this <i>Sea Pigeon</i> is a raider and not a
submarine, seems to be an established fact,” Belding
said. “Sparks got some private information
from the radio station at the Azores and says the
ship is a fast steamer made over from some big,
fat Heinie’s steam yacht he used to race before
the war. She has just sunk a wheat ship from
the Argentine.”</p>

<p>“Sparks” is the nickname usually applied to the
radio operator aboardship, and George Belding
was quite friendly with the chief of the wireless
force on the destroyer.</p>

<p>“George gets all these ‘wireless whispers’ because
he has a pull,” said Whistler, smiling. “If
anything ever happens to Sparks, I expect we’d
see George in there with his head harnessed.”</p>

<p>“And it’s no bad job!” cried Al enthusiastically.
“I’ve often wished I could listen in on this radio
stuff.”</p>

<p>“Oi, oi! That just goes to show the curiosity
of you,” declared Ikey Rosenmeyer, with serious
air. “It is a trait of your character that should
be suppressed, Torry.”</p>


<h2 id='chXIII'>CHAPTER XIII&mdash;THE SUPER-SUBMERSIBLE</h2>


<p>The boys from Seacove and George Belding&mdash;but
especially the last and Phil Morgan&mdash;had a
second topic of daily conversation quite as interesting,
if not as exciting, as that of the German
raider, in chase of which the <i>Colodia</i> was now
driving at top-speed into the southwest.</p>

<p>This topic was the fruitful one of the <i>Redbird</i>
and her cruise to Bahia. If the big sailing ship
had left New York on the date promised, then
the Belding family and Phil’s sisters would now
be off Hatteras&mdash;perhaps even farther south.</p>

<p>“For you can believe me, Belding,” Al Torrance
declared earnestly, and speaking with all
the sea-wisdom acquired during his naval experience,
“that Captain Lawdor would not sail right
out across the Gulf Stream and make the Azores
or the Canaries a landfall, as he might have done
before Hun submarines got to littering up the
Atlantic as they do now.”</p>

<p>“We cannot be altogether sure of his course,”
murmured George Belding.</p>

<p>“Sailing vessels hate to head into the current
of the Gulf Stream,” added Whistler, likewise in
doubt.</p>

<p>“You chaps are determined to expect the very
worst that can happen, aren’t you? Like a fellow
going to have a tooth extracted,” said Al, with
disgust. “Now, listen here! It stands to reason
that news of this new raider, the <i>Sea Pigeon</i>, or
whatever it is they call her, was transmitted to
the other side of the periscope pond. George’s
father and the captain of the <i>Redbird</i> would be
warned before they sailed from New York of this
new danger&mdash;if not afterward, by wireless. Of
course the ship has a radio plant, hasn’t she?”</p>

<p>“Of course,” agreed the shipowner’s son.</p>

<p>“Nuff said! They never in this world, then,
would take the usual course of sailing ships for
South America. They would not cross the Gulf
Stream. It will take the <i>Redbird</i> a little longer
to buck the northerly set of the current; but that
is what Captain Lawdor will do, take it from me!
I figure they are now about off Hatteras, following
the usual course of the coasting vessels.”</p>

<p>“Not much leeway for a big sailing ship,” muttered
George.</p>

<p>“Better hugging the shore, even stormy old
Hatteras, which <i>we</i> know something about, eh,
fellows?” added Al, “than dodging subs and
raiders out in the broad Atlantic.”</p>

<p>He had an old chart and was marking off the
possible course of the <i>Redbird</i> with a lead pencil.</p>

<p>“Good work, Torry,” said Frenchy Donahue.
“It’s navigation officer you’ll be next.”</p>

<p>They were all five deeply interested, and each
day they worked out the probable course of the
sailing ship, as well as figuring the distance she
probably had sailed during the elapsed twenty-four
hours.</p>

<p>“I only hope,” George Belding said, “that we
overtake this <i>Sea Pigeon</i> and finish her before
her commander takes it into his head to steam
across the ocean to the western lanes of travel.
If the raider should intercept father’s ship&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Ah, say!” cried Frenchy, “that ‘if’ is the biggest
word in the language, if it has only two
letters. Don’t worry, Belding.”</p>

<p>That advice was easy to give. George and
Whistler remained very anxious, however; indeed,
they could not help being. Nor did the
activities aboard the destroyer during the next
few days much take their thought off the <i>Redbird</i>
and her company and cargo.</p>

<p>They talked but little&mdash;even to their closest boy
friends&mdash;about the possibility of there being a
great store of coined gold aboard the <i>Redbird</i>.
Just the same, this fact they knew would cause
the ship to be an object of keen attraction to any
sea-raider who might hear of it.</p>

<p>The spy from the Zeppelin had secured George
Belding’s letters in which the gold treasure was
mentioned and Mr. Belding’s voyage in the <i>Redbird</i>
explained. More than a month had elapsed
between the spy-chase behind the little English
port and the sailing of the square-rigged ship
from New York for Bahia, Brazil.</p>

<p>“And you know,” George once said, “a whole
lot can happen in a month. Those Germans have
an ‘underground telegraph’ that beats anything
the negroes and their Northern sympathizers had
during, and previous to, our Civil War.”</p>

<p>“Aw, don’t bring up ancient history,” growled
Al, who tried to be cheerful, but who found it
hard work when the older boys seemed determined
to see the dark side of the shield. “I’ve forgotten
’most all I ever knew about every war before
this one we’re into with both feet&mdash;and <i>then</i>
some!”</p>

<p>“Sure, Torry,” put in Frenchy Donahue, “don’t
you remember the war of that showman who
antedated Barnum&mdash;the one they say got a herd
of elephants over the Alps to fight for him?”</p>

<p>“Oi, oi! Hannibal!” cried Ikey.</p>

<p>“Say! it would take a friend of yours to do
that, Frenchy,” said Al in disgust. “I’ve always
had my doubts about that fellow, Hannibal.”</p>

<p>“Besides,” went on Ikey, going back to Belding’s
statement, “it’s nothing to do with ‘underground’
or any other telegraph. The Germans
use wireless. If that spy got news across the
pond&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Right-o!” broke in George, with increased
good-nature and an answering smile. “But let’s
‘supposing.’ That spy has had ample time to
transmit to friends on the other side of the ocean
information about the gold my father is carrying
to South America.”</p>

<p>“Why,” said Whistler, slowly unpuckering his
lips, “he might even have crossed to New York
himself by this time&mdash;if the British didn’t catch
him.”</p>

<p>“If they had caught him wouldn’t we have been
told?” asked Belding quickly.</p>

<p>“How? By whom?” demanded Whistler.</p>

<p>“Say!” declared Al vigorously, “the British
War Office makes a clam look like it had a tongue
hung in the middle and running at both ends!”</p>

<p>“Now you’ve said something!” muttered
Frenchy.</p>

<p>“That’s right! The world doesn’t even know
how many submarines have been sunk and captured,
already yet,” declared Ikey excitedly. “And
we <i>won’t</i> know, it’s likely, till the end of the war.”</p>

<p>“What’s the odds?” growled Al.</p>

<p>“You got to hand it to them,” sighed Whistler.
“The British have great powers of self-restraint.”</p>

<p>“You said it!” again put in Frenchy.</p>

<p>“Well,” Ikey said, more moderately, “if that
chap that came near sending Belding here west,
was that schmardie’s brother&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Cousin!” interposed Whistler.</p>

<p>“Well&mdash;anyhow and anyway&mdash;Emil Eberhardt&mdash;I
say!” cried Ikey, “he might have got free and
gone over to New York by submarine, or someway,
like Whistler says.”</p>

<p>“What do you suppose he’d do if he wanted
to get that money off the <i>Redbird</i>?” asked
Frenchy, big-eyed.</p>

<p>“Ask us an easier one,” begged Al Torrance.</p>

<p>“You kids are letting your imaginations run
away with you,” put in Phil Morgan.</p>

<p>But in secret the two older boys&mdash;Belding and
Whistler&mdash;did not consider the idea of the spy
reaching New York before the <i>Redbird</i> sailed at
all impossible.</p>

<p>“That chap with the broken arm we took off the
wrecked Zep,” Belding remarked once to Morgan,
“told you his cousin, the ‘super-spy,’ was
bound for America, didn’t he?”</p>

<p>“He dropped such a hint,” admitted the Seacove
lad. “But pshaw! we don’t even know that
Franz Eberhardt referred to the fellow we had
our adventure with.”</p>

<p>“I know! I know!” muttered George Belding.
“But I do wish Willum Johnson, the strong man,
had got his hands on that spy.”</p>

<p>“‘If wishes were horses&mdash;&mdash;’”</p>

<p>“Sure! And perhaps it is all right. At any
rate, father must have got my letter before he
sailed, in which I told him all about losing the
papers and warning him about German plotters.
Of course he must have got that letter.”</p>

<p>But this thought would have afforded them
little comfort had the two friends known that the
ship which bore George Belding’s letter of warning
had been sunk off the Irish coast by a German
U-boat, and that that particular freight or mail
for the United States would probably not be recovered
until after the war.</p>

<p>The <i>Colodia</i> touched at St. Michael and then
at Fayal, receiving in both ports information of
the escapades of the new raider. Lastly she had
been heard of far to the west.</p>

<p>Perhaps she was going across the ocean to prey
on the American coastwise trade! This was a
suggestion that put the Seacove boys and Belding
on edge.</p>

<p>There was, however, something rather uncertain
about the stories regarding the <i>Sea Pigeon</i>.
Some of the merchant crews that had already
met her, declared her to be a huge new submarine&mdash;a
submersible that looked like a steam freighter
when she was afloat, and that she was all of three
hundred feet long.</p>

<p>“Some boat, that!” observed Mr. MacMasters.
“We’ve seen ’em with false upperworks, boys.
But you know, even the <i>Deutschland</i> was no such
submarine as this one they tell about.”</p>

<p>Whistler put forth the idea that there were
two ships working in these waters; but not many
accepted this until, the day after they left Fayal,
and the destroyer was traveling west, Sparks
suddenly picked up an S O S from the south.
The Argentine steamship <i>Que Vida</i> was sending
out frantic calls for help. She was being shelled
by a monster submarine two hundred miles off
the port of Funchal of the Madeiras.</p>

<p>“This is the real thing&mdash;<i>Sea Pigeon</i> or not!”
the radio operator confided to George Belding.
“She’s the super-sub we’ve been hearing about.
The operator on this Buenos Aires’ ship says she
came right up out of the sea at dawn and opened
fire with guns fore and aft. Has used a torpedo,
and has upperworks like a regular honest-to-goodness
steam freighter.</p>

<p>“There! He’s off again!” he exclaimed, as the
radio began to spark, and he turned back to the
machine.</p>

<p>So was the <i>Colodia</i> off again, and at full speed,
dashing away in quest of the <i>Que Vida</i> and the
great submersible that had attacked her.</p>


<h2 id='chXIV'>CHAPTER XIV&mdash;THE MIRAGE</h2>


<p>Phil Morgan, coming up suddenly from the
berth deck just as sweepers were piped at 5:20 in
the morning, fairly overturned a smaller lad who
had been straddling the top of the ladder.</p>

<p>“Hi, you sea-going elephant, you!” complained
Ikey Rosenmeyer’s voice. “Look where you are
going!”</p>

<p>“‘Keep off the engine room hatch’,” chuckled
the older lad, quoting one of the emphasized
orders from the manual. “Haven’t you learned
that yet?”</p>

<p>“No more than you have learned that ‘Whistling
is never permitted aboard ship’,” rejoined
Ikey, getting up and rubbing his elbows.</p>

<p>“Wasn’t whistling!” denied Morgan.</p>

<p>“Well, your lips were all puckered up, just the
same. And you know what old Jehoshaphat,” he
observed, using the nickname for the chief master-at-arms,
“said that time about your doing
that. It’s just as bad to look like you were whistling
as to do it.”</p>

<p>“Aw, he’s deaf and was afraid I was putting
something over on him,” Morgan declared, and
immediately proceeded to “pucker up” again in
a silent tune.</p>

<p>It was true that Phil Morgan had received more
than one demerit when first he had come to sea
because of this proclivity of his for whistling.
He had really been driven to the extremity of
carrying a couple of small burrs under his tongue
to remind him of the infraction of ship rules he
was about to commit whenever he thoughtlessly
prepared to whistle.</p>

<p>The Navy Boys had had a good many rules
besides these two quoted above to learn. And
not only to learn, but to obey! Excuses are not
accepted in the Navy. Anybody who has ever
looked through the Bluejacket’s Manual will be
impressed by these facts.</p>

<p>Every waking hour of the day has its duties
for the men and boys aboard ship. Especially
for the apprentice seamen class to which Whistler
and his friends belonged. Their “hitch” was for
four years, or until they were twenty-one. And
the more they learned and the higher they stood
in their various classes, the better their general
rating would be if they enlisted for a second term.</p>

<p>This last was their intention and expectation.
They were by no means cured of their love for
the sea or their interest in the Navy by the hard
experiences they had suffered.</p>

<p>For that Philip Morgan and his chums had
been through some serious experiences since the
war began could not be overlooked. But they
were just the sort of lads to enjoy what some
people might consider extremely perilous adventures.</p>

<p>The daily routine of duty aboard the <i>Colodia</i>
at times seemed tedious; but the Navy Boys
managed to stir up excitement in some form if
routine became too dull. In fact, the two younger
chums, Ikey Rosenmeyer and Frenchy Donahue,
were inclined to be venturesome and at times they
got into trouble with the authorities.</p>

<p>This fact occasioned Whistler at this early
hour to wonder what Ikey was doing at the head
of the berth deck ladder. This was not the
younger lad’s watch. He caught Ikey by the arm
and led him to the rail. They were careful not
to lean on the rail or on the lifelines, for that was
against orders.</p>

<p>“What are you watching here for, anyway?”
the older lad demanded.</p>

<p>“For the sun,” grinned Ikey.</p>

<p>“What you giving me? You don’t suppose the
sun has forgotten to rise, do you?”</p>

<p>“Dunno. Haven’t seen him yet.”</p>

<p>“It isn’t time.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’m keeping my eyes open,” said Ikey
with twinkling eyes but serious face.</p>

<p>“Shucks! What’s the game, anyway?” demanded
Whistler.</p>

<p>“Why,” said Ikey, “the sun went down so
blamed sudden last night that I wasn’t sure
whether it really set same as usual, or just that
the old fellow went out of business entirely.
Didn’t you notice it?”</p>

<p>“Ah!” exclaimed the older lad, seeing the light,
if not the sunlight. “Don’t you know that we
are getting nearer and nearer to the tropics, and
that there is mighty little twilight there?”</p>

<p>“No!”</p>

<p>“Fact. Night falls very suddenly.”</p>

<p>“‘Sudden!’ You said it!” ejaculated Ikey.
“It’s enough to take your breath. I told Frenchy
I wasn’t sure the sun would ever come up again.”</p>

<p>The fingers of Dawn were already smearing
pale colorings along the eastern sky. The two
boys watched the growing day wonderingly. No
two sunrises are alike at sea, and Whistler was
never tired of watching the changing sky and
ocean.</p>

<p>This was the morning following the S O S
call regarding the attack of the super-submarine
on an Argentine ship. The <i>Colodia</i> was pounding
away at a furious rate toward the place which
the wireless had whispered; but the spot was still
some leagues away.</p>

<p>It was a cloudy morning, the clouds being all
around the horizon with the promise of clear sky
overhead. Windrow upon windrow of mist rolled
up above the horizon. The light in the east was
half smothered by the clouds.</p>

<p>“I guess the old sun will get here on the dot,”
said Whistler, in a mind to turn away to go about
his duties.</p>

<p>“I’m going to wait for him,” said Ikey stubbornly.
“No knowing what tricks he might play.
Hi! Look there!”</p>

<p>Whistler, as well as Ikey, suddenly became interested
in what they saw upon the western sky.
There was a stratum of cloud floating there, beneath
which the horizon&mdash;the meeting line of sky
and sea&mdash;was clear. The spreading light of dawn
imparted to this horizon line a clearness quite
startling. It was as though it had been just
dashed on with a brushful of fresh paint.</p>

<p>The floating cloudland was pearl gray above
and rose pink beneath; and that streak of “fresh
paint” on the horizon line separated this cloudland
from the dull blue water.</p>

<p>The sun would soon pop up above the eastern
sea line, despite Ikey’s pessimism, and his coming
rays were already touching lightly the clouds
above.</p>

<p>“Look at that! Isn’t it great?” breathed
Whistler. “Why, you can just about see through
that cloud. It doesn’t seem real.”</p>

<p>“Clouds aren’t supposed to be very solid,”
scoffed Ikey, unappreciative of the poetry in his
mate’s nature. “Only air and water.”</p>

<p>“Huh! Two of the three principal elements,”
snapped Whistler. “Where’s your science, smart
boy? And that plane of cloud&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Looks just like the flat sea below it,” suggested
Ikey, his interest growing.</p>

<p>“You’re right, it does!” admitted Whistler.
“See! I believe that cloud is a reflection of the
sea beneath. I bet it isn’t a cloud at all!”</p>

<p>“Then I guess I was right,” chuckled Ikey.
“Nothing very <i>real</i> about it, is there?”</p>

<p>Mr. MacMasters came forward along the
<i>Colodia’s</i> deck just as Ikey made this reply. He
addressed the two friends smilingly:</p>

<p>“What is all the excitement, boys? Haven’t
spotted a submarine, have you, Rosenmeyer?”</p>

<p>Whistler turned to the ensign and waved a hand
toward the phenomenon in the west.</p>

<p>“What do you think of that out there, Mr.
MacMasters?” he asked.</p>

<p>“I am not sure, but I think we are being vouchsafed
a sight not often noted at sea&mdash;and at this
hour. It looks like a mirage.”</p>

<p>“Oi, oi!” murmured Ikey. “I understand now
why it looks so funny.”</p>

<p>Whistler said: “Then that is a reflection of
the sea up there in the air?”</p>

<p>“Hanging between sea and sky, yes,” said the
ensign. “A curious phenomenon. But not, in
all probability, a reflection of the sea directly
under that cloudlike vision.”</p>

<p>“No, sir.”</p>

<p>“Probably a reflection photographed on the
clouds of a piece of the ocean at a distance&mdash;just
where one could scarcely figure out even by the
use of the ‘highest of higher mathematics’,” and
the ensign laughed.</p>

<p>“A mirage,” repeated Whistler. “Well, I
never saw the like before.”</p>

<p>“It looks just like a piece of the ocean, doesn’t
it?” said Ikey eagerly. “But there are no
ships&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>He broke off with a startled cry. Mr. MacMasters
and Whistler echoed the ejaculation.
Everybody on deck who had paid any attention to
the mystery in the sky showed increased interest.</p>

<p>Rising slowly and distinctly upon the reflective
surface of the reflected sea was an object which
the onlookers watched with growing excitement
and wonder. It was the outlines of a ship&mdash;but
not an ordinary ship!</p>

<p>It had upperworks and the two stacks of a
steam freighter. It was of the color of the sea
itself&mdash;gray; yet its outlines&mdash;even the wire
stays&mdash;were distinct!</p>

<p>The sea shown in the mirage had been
absolutely empty. Now, of a sudden, this ghostly figure
had risen upon it. Whistler Morgan caught Mr.
MacMasters by the arm. He was so excited that
he did not know he touched the officer.</p>

<p>“Look at it! Do you know what it is?” he
gasped. “That’s a submarine&mdash;a huge submarine.
She’s just risen to the surface.”</p>

<p>“It’s the sub we’re looking for!” cried Ikey,
hoarsely. “My goodness, see it sailing up there
in the sky!”</p>


<h2 id='chXV'>CHAPTER XV&mdash;COMBING THE SEA</h2>


<p>Suddenly the red edge of the sun appeared
above the eastern sea line. He had not forgotten
to rise! For an instant&mdash;the length of the intake
of the breath the two astonished boys drew&mdash;the
mirage painted by nature against the western
sky was flooded with the rising glory.</p>

<p>Then the wonderful picture was erased, disappearing
like a motion picture fade-out, and
there no longer remained any sign of the startling
vision in the sky, save a mass of formless
and tumbled cloud.</p>

<p>“What do you know about that?” murmured
Ikey Rosenmeyer, in amazement.</p>

<p>“You’ll never see the like of it again, boys&mdash;not
in a hundred years,” Ensign MacMasters said
with confidence. “That was a wonderful mirage!”</p>

<p>“But, Mr. MacMasters,” cried Whistler Morgan,
“that vision was the reflection of something
real, wasn’t it? An actual picture of a part of
the sea?”</p>

<p>“So they tell us.”</p>

<p>“Where do you suppose that piece of water
lies?” demanded the youth eagerly.</p>

<p>“I have no idea. ‘Somewhere at sea’! It may
be north, east, south, or west of the <i>Colodia’s</i>
present position. As I tell you, there is no means
of making sure&mdash;that I know anything about,”
he added, shaking his head.</p>

<p>“Oi, oi!” exclaimed Ikey. “Then we don’t
know any more than we did before where that
super-submarine is.”</p>

<p>“If that was a picture of her,” said Whistler
thoughtfully.</p>

<p>“It is truly ‘all in the air’, boys,” laughed Ensign
MacMasters. “We saw something wonderful.
Every mirage is that. But it is a mystery,
too.”</p>

<p>“Maybe that wasn’t the picture of the submarine,
after all,” Ikey suddenly suggested.
“Maybe that was the mirage of a real freighter
we saw. Two stacks and as long as this old
destroyer, I bet! Maybe it only looked as though
it rose from the sea.”</p>

<p>“I’d wager money on it’s being a picture of a
huge German submarine,” said Whistler with
confidence.</p>

<p>“Why so sure, Morgan?” asked the ensign
with curiosity.</p>

<p>“You couldn’t see the water pouring off her
sides as she came up in that mirage,” scoffed Ikey.</p>

<p>“No; but another thing I did notice,” Whistler
declared, answering both the doubting ones.
“She had no flag or ensign flying!”</p>

<p>“Good point!” cried Mr. MacMasters.</p>

<p>“If she had been a regular steamship, no matter
what her business might be, she would have
shown at least a pennant. And we would have
seen it fluttering, for there is a good breeze.”</p>

<p>“Right, my boy,” admitted Mr. MacMasters.
“I must report to the chief. But, of course, we
can have no surety as to the direction of the craft,
nor of her distance from us.”</p>

<p>The mirage caused considerable excitement and
a good deal of discussion aboard the destroyer.
Aside from the more or less “scientific” explanations
offered by the old-time garbies in the crew,
Ikey Rosenmeyer suggested one very pertinent
idea: As he had sighted the ship which two
other witnesses agreed was a submarine, was he
not entitled to the twenty-dollar gold piece which
was Commander Lang’s standing offer for such a
discovery?</p>

<p>“Catch Ikey overlooking any chance for adding
to his bank account,” Al Torrance declared.
“Why, he’s got the first quarter he ever earned
and keeps it in a wash-leather pouch around his
neck.”</p>

<p>“Bejabbers!” agreed Frenchy in his broadest
brogue, “an’ that’s the truth. Did yez iver see
the little flock of trained dimes Ikey’s got?
Wheniver they hear the spindin’ of money mintioned,
they clack in Ikey’s pocket as loud as a
police rattle.”</p>

<p>“You certainly can stretch the truth, Frenchy,”
admonished Belding. “Truth in your facile
fingers becomes a piece of India rubber.”</p>

<p>“Gab, gab, gab!” ejaculated Ikey, seriously.
“It doesn’t prove anything. I want to know if I
am going to get the twenty? I saw the submarine
first.”</p>

<p>“A mirage,” scoffed Frenchy.</p>

<p>“That’s all right. It was a reflection of a
real ship. Mr. MacMasters said so. If I’d seen
a submarine picture in a looking glass, rising
right off yonder,” and he pointed over the rail
of the destroyer, “wouldn’t I have yelled, ‘There
she blows!’ and got the double-eagle?”</p>

<p>“But you gave no alarm,” grinned Al. “Did
he, Whistler?”</p>

<p>“I guess he did call the attention of an officer
to it,” Whistler responded, with great gravity.
“Are you going right up to the Commander with
your claim, Ike?”</p>

<p>While the boys and the rest of the crew were
joking about the mysterious submarine, the officers
of the <i>Colodia</i> were seriously engaged in discussing
the immediate course of the destroyer.
They were under orders to find the <i>Sea Pigeon</i>,
a very fast raider; but they could not refuse very
well to try to pick up this big submersible, if she
could be overtaken.</p>

<p>The wireless messages from the <i>Que Vida</i> had
ceased hours before. That afternoon they sighted
a regular flotilla of small boats on the quiet sea
and knew at once that the submarine had again
been at work. This time, however, the Germans
had been more merciful than usual to the crew of
the sunken ship.</p>

<p>Nevertheless the two life crafts and four boats
were a long way from either Fayal or Funchal.
The sea was quiet, but the German submarine
commander did not know it would remain so.
He had gone directly contrary to international law
in deserting these people.</p>

<p>They proved to be the crew and passengers of
the <i>Que Vida</i>, more than twenty-four hours in the
boats. The captain had been carried away, a
prisoner, by the huge submarine that had attacked
the steamship from Buenos Aires.</p>

<p>The story of the chief officer of the lost ship
was illuminating. The <i>Que Vida</i> might have escaped
the Germans, being a fast vessel, had it not
been for the fact that the former appeared to be
a merchant ship, and flew a neutral flag, as did
the <i>Que Vida</i>.</p>

<p>This enabled the submersible to get within gunfire
range. Suddenly she revealed her guns fore
and aft and threw several shells at the Argentine
vessel. The latter was then so close that she was
obliged to capitulate immediately.</p>

<p>The German then ran down nearer and ordered
her victims to abandon ship within half an hour.
She sent a boat for the captain of the merchant
vessel.</p>

<p>When the boats and rafts were afloat, a boatload
of Germans on their way to put bombs
aboard the <i>Que Vida</i> stopped and pillaged each
boatload of victims, taking their money, jewelry,
any other valuables they fancied, and especially
pilfering the woolen garments of both men and
women.</p>

<p>The <i>Que Vida</i> carried some coin and her captain
was evidently made to tell of this. The Germans
searched the ship before putting the time
bombs in her hold.</p>

<p>“Then, Señores,” said the chief officer, in concluding
his story, “when the poor <i>Que Vida</i> was
sunken, the great submarine steamed away with
Señor Capitan di Cos. Perhaps they have killed
him.</p>

<p>“But we&mdash;Well, you see us. That gr-reat submarine
is the most wonderful ship. I would not
myself have believed she could submerge did I
not see her go down with my own eyes not a
mile away from our flotilla.</p>

<p>“And three hundred feet long she is, I assure
you! As long as this destroyer, Señores. A so
wonderful boat!”</p>

<p>“Once we drop a depth bomb over her, we’ll
knock her into a cocked hat, big as she is,”
growled one of the <i>Colodia’s</i> petty officers in
Whistler’s hearing.</p>

<p>“And the captain of the Spanish ship&mdash;what
of him?” murmured the Seacove lad.</p>

<p>The taking aboard of the wrecked ship’s company
caused considerable excitement on the destroyer.
These torpedo boat destroyers do not
have many comforts to offer passengers, women,
especially.</p>

<p>“Cracky, Whistler!” observed Al Torrance to
his chum, “there are girls come aboard the old
destroyer. What do you know about that?”</p>

<p>“Well, the Old Man couldn’t very well leave
them to drown, could he?” responded Morgan
gravely.</p>

<p>“Spanish girls, too. One is a beauty; but
the other is too fat,” said Frenchy who claimed
to be a connoisseur regarding girls and their looks.</p>

<p>“Hold him, fellows! Hold him!” advised
Ikey, sepulchrally. “He’ll be off again, look out!”</p>

<p>“Aw, you&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Don’t forget how he fell for that Flora girl
when we were back there in England.”</p>

<p>“Shucks!” said Belding laughing. “Flora was
the goddess of flowers.”</p>

<p>“Ah,” said Ikey, shaking his head, “you don’t
know Mike Donahue. He’ll call this Spanish
girl a goddess, yet. You just see.”</p>

<p>The <i>Colodia</i>, however, was driven at top speed
for the nearest port, there to be relieved of the
shipwrecked company from the Argentine steamship.
So the susceptible Frenchy was soon out
of all possible danger.</p>

<p>There was a keen desire, on the part of both
the destroyer’s crew and officers, to overtake the
craft that had brought the <i>Que Vida</i> to her tragic
end.</p>

<p>It was well established now that the big submarine
and the <i>Sea Pigeon</i> were two different
vessels, though they might be working in conjunction.
But either or both of the German craft
would be welcome prey to the United States destroyer.
The latter continued her tedious work
of “combing the sea” for these despicable enemies.</p>


<h2 id='chXVI'>CHAPTER XVI&mdash;STATIONS</h2>


<p>Since sailing out of Brest and before receiving
her special orders by wireless telegraph, the
<i>Colodia</i> had made no base port where the crew
could receive either mail or cablegrams. Two
weeks and more had passed. Philip Morgan and
George Belding had no idea where the <i>Redbird</i>
was, or whether or not their relatives were safe.</p>

<p>“The fate of a ship at sea is an uncertain thing
at best,” Phil Morgan said seriously to his
friend, “in spite of the old salt’s oft-repeated
prayer: ‘Heaven help the folks ashore on this
stormy night, Bill!’”</p>

<p>“Don’t joke about such serious matters,” Belding
replied. “Wonder how far the folks have
got toward Bahia?”</p>

<p>“Well, you know where we stuck the pins in
the chart to-day, boy?”</p>

<p>“To be sure. But we don’t really know a thing
about it.”</p>

<p>“Courage!” urged Whistler. “We are just as
likely to be right in doping out the <i>Redbird’s</i>
course as not.”</p>

<p>“It’s the confounded uncertainty of it that gets
me,” said Belding bitterly, and then changed the
subject.</p>

<p>Interest in the <i>Colodia’s</i> search for German
raiders and submarines did not flag even in the
minds of these two members of her crew. For
several days, however, the destroyer plowed
through the sea, hither and yon, without picking
out of the air a word regarding either the <i>Sea
Pigeon</i> or the huge submarine which some of the
boys believed they had surely seen in the mirage
reflected against the morning sky.</p>

<p>The detail work of a naval vessel at sea even
in wartime, unless something “breaks,” is really
very monotonous. Drills, studies, watch duties,
clothes washing, deck scrubbing, brass polishing.
All these things go on with maddening regularity.</p>

<p>Every time the wireless chattered the watch on
deck started to keen attention. But hour after
hour passed and no word either of the German
raider or the big submarine was caught by Sparks
or his assistants.</p>

<p>Yet there was a certain expectation of possible
action all of the time that kept up the spirits of
the men and boys of the destroyer. At any moment
an S O S might come, or an order from
the far distant naval base for immediate and
exciting work.</p>

<p>The <i>Colodia</i> and her crew were supposed to be
ready for anything&mdash;and she was and they were!</p>

<p>The daylight hours were so fully occupied with
routine detail that the boys made little complaint;
but during the mid-watch and the first half of
the morning watch when the time drags so slowly,
the crew sometimes suffered from that nervous
feeling which suggests to the acute mind that
“something is about to happen.”</p>

<p>On this particular night&mdash;it was mid-watch&mdash;things
were going very easily indeed on the
<i>Colodia</i>. It was a beautiful tropical night, with
a sky of purple velvet in which sparkled more
diamond-stars than Whistler Morgan or George
Belding seemed ever to have seen before.</p>

<p>They were lying on the deck, these two, and
gazing lazily skyward, it not being their trick on
lookout. The <i>Colodia</i> was running as usual with
few lights showing; but not because it was supposed
that there was any other craft, either
friendly or of the enemy, within miles and miles
of her course.</p>

<p>They lay within full hearing of the radio room.
Suddenly the wireless began to chatter.</p>

<p>“Hold on!” exclaimed Whistler, seizing his
friend’s sleeve. “That isn’t a call for you,
George.”</p>

<p>“I’ve got so I jump everytime I hear it,” admitted
Belding, sinking back to the deck.</p>

<p>The messenger soon darted for the commander’s
cabin. It was no immediate order or
signal for help, or he would have first hailed the
bridge. But soon Mr. Lang’s orderly appeared
with a message for the officer of the watch.</p>

<p>There were a few whispered words at the
break of the bridge. Then the officer conning
the ship gave swift directions for her course to
be changed and signaled the engine room as well.
Almost immediately the pace of the destroyer was
increased.</p>

<p>“I wonder what’s in the wind?” murmured
Whistler.</p>

<p>“I’m going to see if I can find out,” said
Belding, rising again.</p>

<p>He went around to the door of the radio
room. Sparks himself was on duty. He sat on
the bench with the helix strap and “eartabs” adjusted.
He had just taken another message, but
it was nothing meant for the commander of the
<i>Colodia</i>.</p>

<p>“That’s the second time to-night, George,” he
said, removing his head-harness. “I don’t know
what to make of it.”</p>

<p>“What’s the matter, sir?” asked the young fellow.</p>

<p>“Why, I guess it’s static. Nothing more, I
suppose. Yet it is a regular ‘ghost talk.’ I can
almost make out words.”</p>

<p>“Goodness! What do you mean?” asked the
young fellow, mightily interested. “I never
heard of ‘ghost talk’, though I know ‘static’ means
atmospheric pressure.”</p>

<p>“Pah! It means electricity in the air that we
can’t wholly account for,” said Sparks. “But
this&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“What?”</p>

<p>“Why, I tell you, George; twice to-night I have
almost caught something that seemed to be a message
in one of our codes and tuned to this length
of spark. But I can’t really make head nor tail
of it.”</p>

<p>“That wasn’t what you just sent aft to the Old
Man?”</p>

<p>“Shucks! No! I’ll give you a tip on that,
young fellow,” and the radio man smiled.
“We’ve been zigzagging across the steamship
routes, but now you will notice that we have an
objective. That message was from Teneriffe in
the Canaries. That big sub has been seen down
that way.”</p>

<p>“Bully!” exclaimed Whistler, who had come
to look into the room over his friend’s shoulder.</p>

<p>“Oh, that you, Whistler? Well, there is
nothing secret about it. But this confounded
‘ghost talk’&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Sounds interesting,” Whistler said.</p>

<p>“I’m puzzled. I hope I’ll catch it again. It
is just as though somebody&mdash;a slow operator, regular
ham&mdash;was trying to put something over and
couldn’t quite do it. Funny things we hear in
the air, anyway, at times.”</p>

<p>He went back to his machine, grumbling, and
the boys came away after a bit. The news that
the super-submersible had been heard of again
was something to talk about, at least, and served
to keep them awake through the rest of the
watch.</p>

<p>In the morning the news that the German submarine
was again active in a certain part of the
ocean to the southward became generally known.
It was likely that the strange and threatening
craft, which plainly could make longer cruises
than most submarines, had been sent forth to
prey upon food ships from South America.</p>

<p>She expected to lurk along steamship lanes,
like a wolf crouched in the underbrush beside
a forest path; and like that wolf, too, she was
relentless. Yet, her treatment of captured ships
thus far had been more humane than most, as
shown by her use of the <i>Que Vida’s</i> crew and
passengers.</p>

<p>“Still, she’s a regular pirate,” Whistler Morgan
said in speaking of this. “See how her men
robbed those poor sailors, and even the women.”</p>

<p>“Ah, you said something then, boy!” Al Torrance
agreed.</p>

<p>“I wonder,” George Belding said reflectively,
“if the war should end suddenly, and some of
these U-boats are out in the various seas, if their
commanders won’t become veritable pirates?”</p>

<p>“How’s that?” cried Frenchy Donahue. “It’s
pirates they are already!”</p>

<p>“But to go it on their own hook,” put in
Ikey. “I see what Belding means. Just think
of a new race of buccaneers! Wow!”</p>

<p>“Begorra!” murmured the Irish lad, his eyes
shining, “they might infest certain seas like the
old pirates of the Spanish Main.”</p>

<p>“I hope you see what you’ve started, George,”
growled Whistler with mock anger. “Those kids
are off again.”</p>

<p>The friends from Seacove were not alone excited
by the renewed chase of the super-submersible.
That day, too, there were two messages
about the German craft. She had sunk a small
freight boat and a fishing sloop. It was evident
that she had run somewhere for supplies, and had
now come back to the island waters.</p>

<p>How many Canary fishermen’s sloops and turtle
catchers she sank during the next few days
will never be known. Mark of such vessels
could not be taken until their crews rowed ashore&mdash;if
they were fortunate enough to get to shore.
The tales the <i>Colodia</i> got by wireless, however,
showed that the Germans were robbing all crews,
as they had the people from the Argentine ship.</p>

<p>From these shore reports, it seemed that the
huge submarine was circling about the steamship
lane again, boldly attacking everything that came
in her way; but it was not until next day that the
destroyer got out of the air a <i>bona fide</i> call for
help. This was from the radio of the British
steamship <i>Western Star</i> bound up the Cape of
Good Hope.</p>

<p>She had merely time to repeat her S O S
signal when her spark was cut off. Doubtless
the radio plant of the freighter was destroyed
by shellfire.</p>

<p>She had, however, given the <i>Colodia</i> clearly
her situation, and the United States destroyer
started upon another of those remarkable dashes
for which she and her sister ships were originally
built.</p>

<p>There was a chance that they might reach the
spot where the <i>Western Star</i> was being held up
before the submarine could get away; and the
<i>Colodia’s</i> crew was at stations, ready for what
was coming.</p>


<h2 id='chXVII'>CHAPTER XVII&mdash;THE SPITFIRE</h2>


<p>That was a great race, as the boys declared.
The engines of the <i>Colodia</i> seemed to pick her
right up and fling her onward over the sea.</p>

<p>They passed no other ship, and after the breakdown
of the <i>Western Star’s</i> wireless, they got but
vague whispers out of the air, and nothing at all
about the huge German submarine that was attacking
the British freighter.</p>

<p>The lookout tops were filled with excited men
and boys; every member of the crew was on the
alert. Tearing on through the calm sea, the destroyer
reeled off the miles as fast as ever she
had since her launching.</p>

<p>Two hours passed. Keen ears distinguished
intermittent explosions from a southerly direction.
Then a smudge of smoke appeared on the
horizon, as though a giant’s thumb had been
smeared just above the sea line.</p>

<p>“There she is!” went up the cry from the destroyer’s
crew.</p>

<p>Their eagerness was increased, were that possible.
As the cloud of smoke grew, they were
all aware that it was from a ship in flames. For
some reason the submarine had not torpedoed the
freighter, but had set her aflame with fire bombs.</p>

<p>Had the crew of the steamship been given a
chance to escape? That question was really the
mainspring of the Americans’ desire to reach in
such a hurry the scene of the catastrophe.</p>

<p>There was the thought of vengeance, too. If
they could but overtake the German pirates and
punish them as they deserved!</p>

<p>“It is all very well,” said Belding, “to put
forth the excuse that these Heinies only do what
they are ordered to do. But how many of us
Yankees, for instance, would obey our officers if
they ordered us to commit such fiendish crimes
as these submarine crews do, right along?”</p>

<p>The chance that the German submarine would
remain in the vicinity of the freighter till she
sank, was not overlooked by the commander of
the <i>Colodia</i>. All on board were urged to keep
their eyes open for the first sign of the enemy.</p>

<p>But it was the refugees from the <i>Western Star</i>
that the destroyer first raised&mdash;a flotilla of small
boats being pulled steadily to the eastward where
lay the islands surrounding Teneriffe.</p>

<p>The <i>Colodia</i> kept away from the survivors,
fearing that she might draw the fire of the submarine
and that thereby the safety of the small
boats would be endangered.</p>

<p>The <i>Western Star</i> was a roaring furnace, from
stem to stern. The smoke and flame billowed out
from her sides, offering a picture of devastation
that was fairly awe-inspiring.</p>

<p>But the sea immediately about the burning ship,
as far as the <i>Colodia’s</i> crew could see, was quite
empty. There was no sign of the enemy submarine.</p>

<p>A signalman called to the bridge, flagged the
survivors, and a man arose in the leading boat
to answer. The Americans made out that the
German submarine had been in the vicinity until
within a very few minutes. She had but recently
disappeared beyond the burning steamship, but
had not at that time submerged.</p>

<p>Commander Lang gave orders for a dash
around the stern of the <i>Western Star</i>. It was
hoped that the approach of the destroyer might
have escaped the notice of the submarine’s commander.</p>

<p>Suddenly there was heard an explosion of a
shell in the hull of the burning ship. A great
balloon of smoke belched forth and the craft
shook from bow to stern. It was evident that
the Germans were getting impatient and wished
the big freighter to sink.</p>

<p>The gunners of the destroyer were at their stations.
There was a chance that they would get a
shot at the submarine before she could submerge.</p>

<p>The <i>Colodia</i> roared on, rounding the stern of
the doomed ship. Another shell burst within her
fire-racked hull; a second explosion followed, and
the hull fairly fell apart amidships!</p>

<p>Then the American destroyer dashed into view
of the enemy. The big submarine lay only two
cable lengths from the sinking ship, all her upper
works visible to the excited Americans. Even
her conning tower was open.</p>

<p>She really did look like a small freighter, even
at that distance. She had collapsible masts and
smokestacks, and there were more than a dozen
men on her deck. It would take some time to
submerge such a craft. Plainly the Germans had
not apprehended the approach of the American
destroyer.</p>

<p>“Hurrah, boys!” yelled one of the petty officers,
“we’re going to take tea with Heinie!”</p>

<p>A roar of voices went up from the decks of the
destroyer in reply to this cheer. A gun fore and
aft spoke; both crews had been ordered to fire
at the same object. That was the open conning
tower of the submarine.</p>

<p>If ever American shells fell true, those two
did! Right at the start the submarine’s chances
for escape were made nil. The conning tower
was wrecked and the craft could not safely submerge.</p>

<p>But she could fight. Her gunners turned their
weapons on the destroyer, and the shells began
to shriek through the upperworks of the fast
naval ship. There were several casualties aboard
the <i>Colodia</i> within the first few minutes.</p>

<p>But the submarine’s most dangerous projectiles,
the auto-torpedoes, could not be successfully used.
As the destroyer swept past, the Germans sent
one of these sharklike things full at her. But the
<i>Colodia</i> darted between the submarine and the
flaming ship, and the projectile passed her
stern, landing full against the side of the
<i>Western Star</i>.</p>

<p>The reverberating crash of the explosion was
enough to wreck one’s eardrums, so near was it.
But all the time the destroyer was giving the
crippled submarine broadside after broadside of
guns; the upperworks of the German craft were
fast becoming a twisted mass of wreckage!</p>

<p>Again and again the Americans’ guns swept
the fated submarine. But the latter was a spitfire.
Behind armored fortresses her men fired
her guns with a rapidity that could but arouse
the admiration of the boys on the <i>Colodia</i>.</p>

<p>“Got to hand it to the Heinies!” yelled somebody.
“They have bulldog pluck.”</p>

<p>“Put a shell where it will do some good, boys!”
begged one of the officers. “We haven’t landed
a hit in her ‘innards’&mdash;and that is where the
shells tell.”</p>

<p>“My goodness!” gasped Whistler, working
beside Al Torrance on one of the forward guns,
“<i>that</i> shell told something&mdash;believe me!”</p>

<p>The shot he meant seemed to have exploded
under the deck of the submarine. Yards upon
yards of the armorplate was lifted and splintered
as a baseball might splinter a window.</p>

<p>The destroyer was rounding the submarine at
top speed. Volley after volley was poured into
the rocking German craft. One shell wiped out
a deck gun and all the Germans manning it. The
slaughter was terrible.</p>

<p>And yet her remaining guns were worked with
precision&mdash;with desperate precision. She could
not hold the range as the Americans did, but her
crew showed courage as well as perfect training.
The position of the submarine was hopeless, yet
they fought on.</p>

<p>Sweat was pouring into Phil Morgan’s eyes
as he worked with his crew members over the
hot gun. The sun was scorching, anyway; it was
the very hottest place he and Al Torrance had
ever got into, counting the big fight when they
were with the <i>Kennebunk</i>, and all!</p>

<p>The destroyer received very little punishment.
If the submarine did fight like a spitfire, her
shells accomplished little damage.</p>

<p>The Americans saw the big burning steamship
fall apart in the middle and sink after the torpedo
struck her. Great waves lifted their crests over
the spot, and it was at this time the submarine
was put in the greatest danger.</p>

<p>The spreading billows caught the helpless submersible
and tossed her on their crests. Those
on the <i>Colodia</i> saw the Germans running about
the deck like ants about a disturbed ant hill. Then
a huge wave topped the ship and broke over her!</p>

<p>A cheer started among the crew of the destroyer.
But it was quenched in a moment.
When the great wave rolled past they saw that
the submarine had been flung upon its side and
that it was sinking.</p>

<p>“She’s going down, boys! She’s going down!”
cried George Belding. “Don’t cheer any more&mdash;now.”</p>

<p>Indeed the awful sight completely checked
cheering. It is all right to fight an enemy; it is
another matter to see that enemy sink beneath
the waves.</p>

<p>And the strangeness of this incident impressed
the lads seriously as well. The submarine’s own
act had sunk her. She had been overborne by a
wave from the sinking of the freighter.</p>

<p>“She brought about her own punishment,” remarked
Whistler, voicing the general opinion of
the crew of the American destroyer. “In other
words, it was coming to them and they got it!”</p>


<h2 id='chXVIII'>CHAPTER XVIII&mdash;“GHOST TALK” AGAIN</h2>


<p>The <i>Colodia</i> was put about, and at reduced
speed approached the spot where the submarine
had gone down. There was very little wreckage
on the surface of the ocean; but several black
spots seen through the officers’ glasses caused two
boats to be hastily launched and both were driven
swiftly to the rescue of the survivors of the
German craft.</p>

<p>Morgan was in one of these boats. All through
the fight he had thought of the Argentine skipper,
Captain di Cos of the <i>Que Vida</i>. The possibility
of his still being aboard the submarine worried
the American lad. If there were prisoners, they
had gone down with the enemy craft.</p>

<p>These were the fortunes of war; nevertheless,
that the unfortunates should be lost with the
members of the German crew, was a hard matter.
Only three survivors were picked up, and
one of them, with his arm torn off at the socket,
died before the boats could get back to the destroyer.</p>

<p>The two were Germans. Questioned about
possible prisoners aboard the submarine, they
denied knowledge of them. Yet it was positive
that Captain di Cos, at least, had been carried
away by the German craft when the <i>Que Vida</i>
was sunk.</p>

<p>Later some information was gleaned from the
two prisoners brought back to the <i>Colodia</i>. The
super-submarine had been known as the One
Thousand and One. She was the first of a new
type of subsea craft that the Germans hoped to
use as common carriers if they won the war.</p>

<p>According to the story told by the prisoners&mdash;especially
by one who was more talkative than his
fellow&mdash;the huge submarine had a crew of sixty
men, with a captain for commander, a full lieutenant
and a sub-lieutenant. She was fully provisioned
and carried plenty of shells. Her commander’s
desire to save torpedoes, their supply of
which could not be renewed nearer than Zeebrugge
or Kiel, was the cause of the submarine
being caught unaware by the destroyer.</p>

<p>Had the <i>Western Star</i> been sunk at once by
the use of a torpedo, the underseas boat would
have been far away from the scene when the
American ship arrived. It was an oversight!</p>

<p>“And it is an oversight her commander can
worry about all through eternity,” Mr. MacMasters
growled, in talking about it with the boys he
took into his confidence now and then. “It is
my idea that that big sub could get stores and oil
without running home to her base; but she could
not get torpedoes.”</p>

<p>He did not explain further what Commander
Lang and his officers suspected. But the German
prisoners had been interrogated very carefully
along certain lines, especially regarding that German
raider called the Sea Pigeon for which the
<i>Colodia</i> had really been sent in search.</p>

<p>The big submarine had taken considerable
treasure and valuable goods from the vessels she
had sunk. Then, for a time, she had disappeared
from the steamship lanes. Where had she gone
with the stolen goods?</p>

<p>The prisoners hesitated to explain this. Indeed,
one of them became immediately dumb
when he saw what the questioning was leading
to. From his companion, however, was obtained
some further information.</p>

<p>It was a fact that the submarine had left her
base with the raider known as the <i>Sea Pigeon</i>.
The underseas boat convoyed the bigger craft
through the danger zone. It was not a difficult
guess that when the two German boats had
separated arrangements had been made for
certain rendezvous at future dates&mdash;when and
where? Besides, both boats were furnished with
wireless.</p>

<p>“I would make that Heinie tell the whole
story,” Ensign MacMasters said.</p>

<p>“He might not tell the truth, sir,” suggested
Whistler Morgan.</p>

<p>“Then I’d hang him,” declared the officer. “A
threat of that kind will make these brave Heinies
come to time. I know ’em!”</p>

<p>Commander Lang had his own way of going
about this matter. He used his own good judgment.
Whether he believed he had obtained the
full truth from the prisoners or not about the
<i>Sea Pigeon</i>, he turned the destroyer’s prow toward
the reaches of the western Atlantic, leaving
the eastern steamship lanes behind.</p>

<p>The crew only knew that the <i>Colodia</i> must be
following at least some faint trail of the raider.
For the destroyer had been sent to get the German
ship, and Commander Lang was not the man
to neglect his work.</p>

<p>The radio men picked plenty of chatter out of
the air; but, as far as the Navy Boys knew,
though they tried to find out, little of it referred
to the German raider.</p>

<p>One thing George Belding did learn from his
friend, Sparks: The “ghost talk” was rife in
the static once more. This wireless spectre had
all the operators in a disturbed state of mind, to
say the least.</p>

<p>“Sparks seems to have lost his common sense
for fair, over it,” Al Torrance observed. “You
know more about this aero stuff than any of us,
George. What do you really think it is? Somebody
trying to call the <i>Colodia</i>?”</p>

<p>“That is exactly what Sparks doesn’t know.
He admitted to me that he caught the destroyer’s
name, but not her number. It’s got so now this
‘ghost’ breaks in at a certain time in the afternoon
watch&mdash;just about the same time each day. One
of his assistants says he has spelled out ‘<i>Colodia</i>,’
too. But it may be nothing but a game.”</p>

<p>“How ‘game’?” asked Ikey eagerly.</p>

<p>“Somebody fooling with a machine. Sparks
says the sounds grate just like ‘static!’”</p>

<p>“And that is as clear as mud,” complained
Frenchy Donahue.</p>

<p>“Could this unexplained talk be some new German
code?” Whistler Morgan asked.</p>

<p>“All Sparks got is in English; but it doesn’t
amount to any sense, he says. If it is a code, he
never heard the like before.”</p>

<p>“It might be a German code with English
words,” put in Al. “One word in code means a
whole sentence.”</p>

<p>“I believe you! Wish Sparks would let me put
on the harness and listen in on it,” grumbled
Belding. “I haven’t forgotten the wireless Morse
I learned back there before the war.”</p>

<p>“Go to it, George,” urged Al.</p>

<p>“I wish I knew Morse,” added Whistler. “Get
into it, George. Get Sparks to let you try a round
with the ‘ghost talk.’ He is friendly to you.”</p>

<p>Thus encouraged, Belding took a chance with
the chief of the radio during that very afternoon
watch. It was during these hours, it was reported,
that the strange and mysterious sounds
broke in upon the receiving and sending of the
operators aboard the <i>Colodia</i>.</p>

<p>“It is against the rules to let you into this room,
boy,” Sparks told him, smiling. “I can’t give up
my bench to a ham.”</p>

<p>“I’m no ham, Mr. Sparks,” declared Belding.
“I’ve shown you already that I can read and
send Morse.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” the radio man murmured,
shaking his head.</p>

<p>But he was really fond of George Belding, and
the latter had to coax only a little more. This,
as a rule, was not a busy hour.</p>

<p>He allowed the youth to slide in on the bench
and handed him the head harness. George slipped
the hard rubber discs over his ears and tapped
the slide of the tuner with a professional finger.</p>

<p>“Plenty of static,” he observed, for it was
trickling, exploding, and hissing in the receivers.</p>

<p>“No induction,” Sparks suggested.</p>

<p>Belding slid up the starting handle. The white-hot
spark exploded in a train of brisk dots and
dashes. Belding snapped up the aerial switch
and listened. The message he was catching from
the air was nothing to interest him or the <i>Colodia</i>.</p>

<p>He was sensitizing the detector and soon adjusted
the tuning handle for high waves. The
chief watched him with a growing appreciation
of the boy’s knowledge of the instrument and its
government.</p>

<p>On these high planes the ether was almost
soundless. Only a little static, far-removed,
trickled in. It was in the high waves that most
of the naval work is done and the sending of
orders to distant ships is keyed as fine as a violin
string&mdash;and sounds as musical.</p>

<p>Sliding the tuning handle downward, Belding
listened for commercial wave-lengths. Something&mdash;something
new and unutterably harsh&mdash;stuttered
in his ear.</p>

<p>He jerked back from the instrument and
glanced suspiciously at Sparks.</p>

<p>“Do you hear it?” the latter demanded.</p>

<p>“I hear something,” said the young fellow
grimly. “It&mdash;beats&mdash;me&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>Were these the sounds that had been disturbing
the radio men, off and on, for a week or
more? Laboriously, falteringly, the rasping
sounds grated against Belding’s eardrums. It
was actually torturing!</p>

<p>The atrocious sending began, in Belding’s ear,
to be broken into clumsy dots and dashes. The
wave-lengths were not exactly commercial; nor
did the sending seem to be in the Continental
code.</p>

<p>He listened and listened; he turned the tuner
handle up and down. He got the soundwaves
short and got them long; high and low as well.
But one fact he was sure of: they were the same
sounds&mdash;the same series of clumsy dots and
dashes&mdash;repeated over and over again!</p>

<p>George Belding swung at last from the instrument
and tore off the receiving harness. Sparks
was grinning broadly upon him.</p>

<p>“Ugh!” ejaculated the youth. “Is it a joke?
I am almost deafened by the old thing.”</p>

<p>“What do you make out the ghost talk to be,
George?”</p>

<p>“Are you sure it isn’t a joke?”</p>

<p>“Not on my part, I do assure you,” declared
the radio man.</p>

<p>“Then,” said Belding slowly, “I believe somebody
is trying to communicate a message and
for some reason can’t quite put it through.”</p>

<p>“Did you get the word ‘<i>Colodia</i>’?” Sparks
asked quickly.</p>

<p>“No, sir. But one word I believe I did get,”
said the young fellow gravely.</p>

<p>“What’s that?”</p>

<p>“‘Help,’” Belding repeated. “‘H-e-l-p, Help.’
That’s what I got and all I got. I do not think
I am mistaken in that!”</p>


<h2 id='chXIX'>CHAPTER XIX&mdash;A DIFFERENCE OF OPINION</h2>


<p>Had George Belding not been such a stubborn
fellow he never would have stuck to his opinion
about the strange call received by the <i>Colodia’s</i>
radio men, by wireless telegraph. For neither
the chief, called Sparks, nor his assistants or students
(the latter scornfully entitled “hams”) had
spelled anything like “help” out of the strange
sounds to which Belding’s attention had been
called.</p>

<p>“Don’t tell me such stuff,” insisted the chief.
“That’s as old as the hills, George. When I first
went into wireless, it used to be the standing joke
to feed the student a ‘Help! We are lost’ call to
steady his nerves. It was called C D Q in those
old times.”</p>

<p>“I am not kidding,” said George Belding rather
sullenly, for he did not like to be laughed at.</p>

<p>“No. And don’t try to make me believe that
anybody is trying to kid you with a ‘help’ call,”
Sparks said, shaking his head.</p>

<p>But as we have said, George was stubborn.
Sparks thought he had spelled out the name of
the destroyer in those grating sounds. If so,
why shouldn’t it be just as reasonable that Belding
had heard the dots and dashes spelling
‘h-e-l-p’?</p>

<p>Belding put this up to Whistler and Al when
he had a chance to tell them about it in the first
dog watch. He was not excited at all. He simply
did not like to have his word doubted or be
laughed at by Sparks.</p>

<p>“As for being laughed at,” the very sensible
Philip Morgan said, “it strikes me that I wouldn’t
be worried by that. Your opinion is just as good
as old Sparks’ or anybody else’s, for that matter.
Eh, Al?”</p>

<p>“Why not?” returned the other Seacove boy.
“It was George heard the sounds, not Sparks.
Get a chance to listen in again, George.”</p>

<p>“Can it be possible that there is somebody trying
to send a message for help to the <i>Colodia</i>?”
Whistler went on slowly.</p>

<p>“Cracky!” ejaculated Al, “I didn’t think of
that.”</p>

<p>“Sparks says that he thought he spelled out
the destroyer’s name. George has heard the word
‘help.’ Get after it, George!” he added, earnestly.
“Don’t let ’em put you down.”</p>

<p>“But who under the sun would be doing such
a thing?” demanded Al. “Is it a joke, after all?”</p>

<p>“It will be a sorry joke if our Government gets
after the sender. The law is mighty strict about
private wireless plants, you know,” said Phil
Morgan.</p>

<p>“There is one sure thing,” declared Belding.
“If anybody is trying to call this ship, they don’t
know much about the regulation codes and sendings.
They don’t know the destroyer’s number,
and the way they handle Morse is a caution to
cats!”</p>

<p>“Stick to it,” advised Whistler.</p>

<p>But George did not really need to be urged in
this direction. The next afternoon watch he was
back at the radio room begging to “listen in”
again. Because of the interest the radio men
had begun to feel in the “ghost talk” in the air
at this time of day, both Sparks and one of his
assistants were on hand.</p>

<p>The regular radio men were listening for the
peculiar voice in the wireless, at all hours; but it
seemed to be confined now to an hour or two in
mid-afternoon. One after the other the <i>Colodia’s</i>
radio force slipped on the receiving harness and
listened to the mystery. Belding got his chance,
in spite of the fact that Sparks laughed at him.</p>

<p>This time Belding kept the instrument tuned
down to the commercial waves on which it seemed
the “ghost talk” was the more easily transmitted.
Now and then he got the spelling of a letter
clearly. But not a word in its entirety did he
hear on this day&mdash;not even “help.”</p>

<p>“I get ‘r’, ‘d’, and ‘b’ a lot,” he signed, turning
the receiver over to Sparks again. “They are in
rotation&mdash;‘r’, ‘d’, ‘b’&mdash;and sometimes there follows
another ‘d’. There are letters missing between
them, excepting between the ‘b’ and the
first ‘d’.”</p>

<p>“No ‘help’ stuff, eh?” queried Sparks.</p>

<p>“Nor any ‘<i>Colodia</i>’,” snorted Belding.</p>

<p>But he sat and watched the radio chief give his
full attention to the mystery, and after a minute
or two saw that the man was spelling something
out carefully on the pad of scratch-paper under
his hand. Belding peered over his shoulder and
saw Sparks set down these letters as he heard
them in the sound waves:</p>

<blockquote>
R DB<br>
R DB R<br>
R DB D<br>
RE B D<br>
R D RD<br>
R DB<br>
RE I
</blockquote>

<p>Sparks pulled off the harness and swung about
to look at George Belding.</p>

<p>“Is that about what you heard?” he demanded.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir. At least, in part.”</p>

<p>“Well, hang it all!” cried Sparks. “That’s a
still newer combination. It’s neither ‘<i>Colodia</i>’
nor ‘help.’ I tell you it beats me, George.”</p>

<p>When Belding left the wireless room he took
with him the piece of paper on which Sparks had
written. The letters in combination seemed to
mean nothing; but he showed them to Whistler
and Al Torrance when he found those two chums
together.</p>

<p>“Looks like one of those puzzles they have on
the back page of the papers at home,” said Al.
“You know: The ones you are supposed to fill in
with other letters to make ’em read the same up
and down and across.”</p>

<p>“This is no acrostic,” said Belding firmly.</p>

<p>But Whistler stared steadily at the paper for
some minutes without saying a word. Only his
lips slowly puckered, and Al nudged him to break
off the thoughtful whistle which he knew his
chum was about to vent.</p>

<p>“Huh? Oh! All right,” murmured Morgan,
accepting Al’s admonition.</p>

<p>“What do you see?” asked Belding.</p>

<p>“I see that it is the same word each time, of
course,” replied Whistler. “But I don’t believe
my eyes.”</p>

<p>“What’s that?” demanded the other two boys.</p>

<p>“If the ghost of the air,” said Whistler gravely,
“did not spell out the name of this destroyer this
afternoon, it certainly did try to put over the
name of another ship.”</p>

<p>“Wow!” exclaimed Al. “Tell us.”</p>

<p>“What ship do you mean?” asked Belding,
scowling thoughtfully at the paper.</p>

<p>Quickly Whistler covered the letters on the
sheet as, with his own pencil, he filled in the gaps
between them. When he flashed the sheet before
the eyes of his two friends each of the lines of
letters made the same word. And that word was:</p>

<blockquote>
“REDBIRD”
</blockquote>

<p>“My goodness! You have gone crazy, Phil
Morgan!” almost shouted Belding.</p>

<p>“Cracky! that’s the ship your sisters and Belding’s
folks are aboard, you know,” gasped Torry.
“Why, Whistler, I believe with George that you
<i>are</i> crazy!”</p>

<p>“All I see,” said Morgan, quite unruffled, “is
that George brought us some letters that, very
easily and sensibly, make the name of his father’s
ship now bound for Bahia.”</p>

<p>“Cracky!” exclaimed Al again.</p>

<p>“But&mdash;but do you suppose anything has happened
to father, mother and the girls? Do you
really, Morgan?”</p>

<p>“Who said anything about ‘something happening’
to them?” demanded his friend with some
heat. “I am merely pointing out the possibility
that the name of that ship is in a wireless message
that somebody seems anxious to put over.”</p>

<p>“But who&mdash;what&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Exactly!” exclaimed Whistler, stopping
Belding at that point. “We don’t know. We have
merely learned that the radio men first spelled out
the name of this destroyer. Now you and the
chief have caught the name of the <i>Redbird</i>. The
two names seem to be in the combination. Therefore,
is it ‘crazy’, as you fellows say, for me to
suggest that perhaps the mysterious message deals
with both of the vessels named?”</p>

<p>“I begin to see your idea, Phil,” admitted Belding.
“But it did shake me. You know, I spelled
out ‘help’ first of all.”</p>

<p>“But you did not get that to-day,” said Whistler
quickly. Then he added: “We know the
<i>Redbird</i> is fitted with wireless.”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps somebody aboard is trying to send a
message to us just for fun.”</p>

<p>“For fun, indeed!” exclaimed Al Torrance.
“People aren’t fooling with the radio ‘for fun’ in
these times.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know. You know how girls are,”
drawled Whistler. “George, does your sister
Lilian know anything about Morse and the
radio?”</p>

<p>“Oh, my prophetic soul!” gasped Belding, suddenly
arousing to the point Whistler made. “I
should say she did! Lil got to be fairly good at
both sending and receiving when we had the plant
on the roof of our house.”</p>

<p>“Could this be Lilian trying to get a message
over to us&mdash;just for fun?”</p>

<p>“Cut out the ‘fun’ business,” implored Al.
“That doesn’t sound reasonable.” But that was
the very idea that caught George Belding.</p>

<p>“She’s that kind of girl,” he declared. “Tell her
she must not do a thing, and she’s sure to try it.
But I don’t understand&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Of course, it’s only a guess on my part,”
Whistler said quickly. “But can’t you think of
some way to try her out&mdash;identify her, you know?
Tell Sparks what you think and get him to let you
try to send her a message.”</p>

<p>“Whew!” exclaimed Al. “So there’s nothing
more than <i>that</i> in it? Shucks! Another mystery
gone fooey.”</p>

<p>“Phil’s idea does sound awfully reasonable,”
added Belding, evidently much relieved in his
mind.</p>

<p>Phil Morgan’s countenance did not reveal his
secret gravity. He still remembered that the
word “help” had been connected with the names
of the two craft&mdash;the destroyer and the merchant
vessel&mdash;which seemed to be a part of the strange
message out of the air.</p>


<h2 id='chXX'>CHAPTER XX&mdash;TOO LATE AGAIN</h2>


<p>If the Seacove boys, George Belding and the
radio force, found an interest aside from the general
object of the <i>Colodia’s</i> cruise, the bulk of the
crew were not so fortunate. Their keen outlook
for the German raider the <i>Sea Pigeon</i>, began to
be dulled as the tropical days dragged by.</p>

<p>The destroyer was running down a westerly
course near enough to the equatorial regions to
cause every one to feel the languor that usually
affects the northern-born in southern climes. The
boys lolled around the decks, and found drill and
stations hard tasks indeed.</p>

<p>Everybody said: “Is it hot enough for you?”
And with the permission of the executive officer
more than half the crew slept on deck instead of
below in their hammocks.</p>

<p>During a part of the afternoon watch the engines
of the destroyer were stopped, a life-raft
was lowered on the shady side of the ship, and
the boys in squads were allowed to bathe, the
quartermaster’s boat with two sharpshooters in it,
lying off a few yards on the watch for sharks.</p>

<p>The <i>Colodia</i> had an objective point, however,
toward which she was heading without much loss
of time. Hour after hour she steamed at racing
speed and through an ocean that seemed to be
utterly deserted by other craft.</p>

<p>In those wartimes the lanes of steam shipping,
and sailing craft as well, had been changed. Ships
sometimes sailed far off their usual course to
reach in safety a port, the track to which was
watched by the German underseas boats. The
<i>Colodia</i> would ordinarily have passed half a hundred
ships on this course which she followed
toward the American shores.</p>

<p>Cruising the seas, whether for pleasure, profit,
or on war bent, is a very different thing nowadays
from formerly. Practically this change has been
brought about by a young Italian who had a
vision.</p>

<p>No longer does a ship go blindly on her course,
unable to learn who may be her neighbor, deaf
to what the world ashore is doing as long as she
remains out of port.</p>

<p>The wireless telegraph has made this change.
The radio furnishes all the gossip of sea and land.
Even in wartime the news out of the air puts
those at sea in touch with their fellowmen.</p>

<p>All day long, and through the night as well,
the radio force on the <i>Colodia</i> might listen to the
chatter of the operators on land and sea.
Unnecessary conversation between operators is
frowned upon; but who is going to “listen in” on
a couple of thousand miles of wireless and report
private conversations between working radio
men?</p>

<p>On the <i>Colodia</i> a man was at the instrument
practically every minute, day or night. Commercial
messages, weather warnings, code sendings
of three or four Governments, the heavy soundwaves
from Nauem, the German naval headquarters,
flashes from ship to ship&mdash;all this grist
passed through the wireless mill of the destroyer.</p>

<p>All the time, too, they were seeking news of
the <i>Sea Pigeon</i>, the German raider, which the
<i>Colodia</i> had been sent out particularly to find.
Of course, the finish of the submarine One Thousand
and One had been reported to the naval base,
and an emphatic, “Well done!” had been returned.
But the sinking of the submarine, after all, was
not the main issue.</p>

<p>As the destroyer had combed the sea for her
prey, so she combed the air by her wireless for
news of the raider. And when the news came it
was as unexpected as it was welcome. The men
were offering wagers that the destroyer would
end in seeing New York again rather than sighting
the <i>Sea Pigeon</i>, when just after the wheel and
lookout were relieved at four bells of the morning
watch, the radio began to show much activity.</p>

<p>Messengers passed, running to and fro from
the station to the officers’ quarters. There was
not usually much radio work at this hour, and the
watch on deck began to take notice.</p>

<p>George Belding slid around to the radio room
and showed a questioning countenance to Sparks
who was himself on duty.</p>

<p>“What’s doing, sir?” he asked the radio chief.</p>

<p>“Well, we haven’t picked up your particular
S O S; but there is trouble somewhere dead
ahead.”</p>

<p>“I can feel that the engines are increasing
speed, sir,” Belding said. “Does it mean that we
may have a scrap with a sure-enough Hun?”</p>

<p>“The message sounds like it,” admitted the
radio man softly. “There’ll be trouble, I reckon.
You’ll hear all about it, soon enough.”</p>

<p>Commander Lang himself appeared on the
bridge, and this was a surprisingly early hour for
him. Other officers gathered, and there began a
somewhat excited conference. The boatswain’s
mates failed to pipe the clothes lines triced up.
Half an hour earlier than usual the hammocks
were ordered stowed. Ikey Rosenmeyer, who
loved to sleep till the last minute, was tumbled
out unceremoniously and had to stow his hammock
in his shirt!</p>

<p>The hammock stowers likewise stopped down
the hammock cloths early, and the whole crew
had their mess gear served out long before the
galley was ready to pipe breakfast. During the
meal hour word was passed to shift into uniform
instead of work clothes.</p>

<p>“It’s extra drill, I bet,” declared one of the
boys pessimistically. “More work for the wicked.”</p>

<p>“There is something doing, sure enough,” Phil
Morgan declared. “I think we shall be piped to
stations before long.”</p>

<p>He had not seen George Belding then. When
the latter reported what he had heard at the radio
room Whistler was more than ever confident that
there was something of importance about to take
place. It was some time, however, before the real
fact went abroad among the members of the crew.</p>

<p>The radio had indeed brought news at last of
the raider. She was supposed to be lurking near
a point not more than two hours’ run ahead of the
<i>Colodia</i>. A report from a cattleship had been
caught, stating that she was chased just at daybreak
by a steamship that was heavily armed
with deck guns, and that she surely would have
been overtaken by the enemy had fog not shut
down and given the cattle boat a chance to zig-zag
away on a new course.</p>

<p>The description of the attacking vessel fitted
that of the raider, <i>Sea Pigeon</i>. Commander Lang
and his officers believed that there was a chance
of meeting the German&mdash;of approaching her, indeed,
unheralded.</p>

<p>There was a good deal of fog about; but overhead
the sky was clear and there was the promise
of a hot day before noon. Having the approximate
latitude and longitude of the cattleship
when she sighted the raider, Commander Lang
believed the <i>Colodia</i> had a good chance of overtaking
the German ship while she was lingering
about on the watch for her prey.</p>

<p>The fog was growing thinner, but had by no
means entirely disappeared even in the vicinity
of the destroyer, when her wireless began to
chatter. Sparks sent a messenger on the run to
the bridge. This incident visibly increased the
excitement of both officers and crew. Word was
passed in whispers from the petty officers stationed
near the bridge that the call was another
S O S.</p>

<p>A second message followed almost immediately.
The <i>Colodia’s</i> engines were speeded up.
The crew was piped to quarters. The gun crews
made ready their initial charges. Everything about
the decks was properly stopped down and the destroyer
was quickly put into battle trim.</p>

<p>Message after message came from the radio
room. Belding came breathlessly to Whistler and
Al Torrance with the announcement that it was
a sugar ship being attacked, and surely by the
raider. Soon the distant reports of guns could be
heard.</p>

<p>“If the <i>Susanne</i> can only hold the Heinies off
till we get there,” said Belding, who had learned
the name of the sugar-laden ship, “we will show
them something.”</p>

<p>“We will show them if the German raider isn’t
too fast for us,” responded Al. “They say this
<i>Sea Pigeon</i> is mighty fast and a pretty nifty boat
into the bargain.”</p>

<p>“The old <i>Colodia</i> will show her,” said Whistler
with confidence. “Just give us a chance!”</p>

<p>The destroyer plowed on through both sea and
fog, while the rumble of the guns grew in magnitude.
Whether much damage was being done or
not, a good many shots were exchanged by the
combatants. It might have been a veritable naval
engagement.</p>

<p>The fog swirled about the bows of the <i>Colodia</i>,
and the lookouts strained their eyes to catch the
first glimpse of the fighting ships. As the fog
was thinning from above, the watchers in the tops
had the best chance of first sighting the sugar
ship and the raider that had attacked her.</p>

<p>A wireless transmitted news of the fight as it
progressed. The Germans had not yet succeeded
in putting the merchant ship’s radio out of commission.
In response, the destroyer had assured
the <i>Susanne</i> of her own approach.</p>

<p>“Hold on! We are coming!” the <i>Colodia’s</i>
radio had sent forth.</p>

<p>“Enemy half mile off. Steaming two knots to
our one,” came the response from the sugar ship.</p>

<p>“Fight it out! We are coming!” repeated
Sparks from the destroyer.</p>

<p>“Shell has burst abaft the afterhouse companion.
Two of after gun crew killed. Volunteers
take their places. We have put a shell
through enemy’s upperworks.”</p>

<p>“Great! Keep it up!” chattered the <i>Colodia’s</i>
radio.</p>

<p>“Another shell has reached us aft. Women
and children sent forward to forecastle.”</p>

<p>The final sentence, read aloud by an officer
from the bridge, excited the crew of the <i>Colodia</i>
to the utmost.</p>

<p>The American seamen were spurred to fighting
pitch now. Their only desire was to get at the
raider and her crew.</p>

<p>“It’s a running fight between her and the
<i>Susanne</i>,” Morgan said to Al Torrance. “Otherwise
the German shells might have reached the
sugar ship’s engines before this.”</p>

<p>“Think of them shelling that merchant ship
that has women passengers aboard!” groaned Al.
“What can those Germans be thinking of? What
will happen to them after this war is over?”</p>

<p>“They all believe they are going to win,” Belding
said gloomily. “That is what is the matter.
And if they <i>should</i>, the whole world will be
treated just as ruthlessly as the Germans please.”</p>

<p>“Don’t talk that way! Don’t talk that way!”
shouted Al. “I won’t listen to such a possibility!
They can’t win this war, and that’s all there is
to it!”</p>

<p>“Quiet, there,” admonished the voice of an
officer, and the boys subsided to whispered comments,
one to the other.</p>

<p>Again and again the wireless chattered the cry
for help. The guns thundered ahead. Suddenly
there arose a rosy light in the sky, spreading
through the fog in a wide wave of color.</p>

<p>“She’s blown up!” was the general and hopeless
ejaculation from the crew of the destroyer.</p>

<p>“Her engines went that time, sure enough&mdash;and
her boilers, too,” groaned Ensign MacMasters,
who chanced to stand near the gun crew to
which Whistler and Al belonged and where Belding
was stationed in reserve. “She’s helpless
now. If we don’t get there soon&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>There were no more radio messages. The calls
to the <i>Susanne</i> were not answered. The melting
fog soon gave the lookouts a clearer view ahead.</p>

<p>“Steamship tops and rigging in sight, sir!” was
the cry to the bridge. Then, a minute later:
“She’s on fire, sir, and sinking by the stern.”</p>

<p>“Ah!” muttered Ensign MacMasters. “We are
too late again!”</p>


<h2 id='chXXI'>CHAPTER XXI&mdash;THE MYSTERY MESSAGE</h2>


<p>In a very few minutes the crew of the <i>Colodia</i>&mdash;all
those above deck, at least&mdash;gained a view
of the burning ship.</p>

<p>She was completely wrecked at the stern, and
it was probably true, as Ensign MacMasters had
said, that her engines and boilers had been blown
up. She lay helpless and sinking.</p>

<p>All her passengers and her crew had been
driven forward by the flames. The bow of the
steamship was slanting up into the air at a threatening
angle. The men were lowering such boats
as there remained from the forward davits.</p>

<p>The <i>Susanne’s</i> bulk, the smoke, and the last
shreds of the fog hid the enemy from the view
of the destroyer’s crew. But suddenly they saw
a high-powered motor-boat appear beside the
crippled steamship. Armed men filled it. Two
stood up as the boat swung in to the steamship’s
side and caught the hanging davit ropes. They
hooked these ropes to the launch, fore and aft.</p>

<p>As quickly as one can tell it, the Germans
“tailed on” to the ropes and hauled their own
boat into the air. In a minute she overhung the
rail of the sugar ship and the Germans swarmed
out upon her deck.</p>

<p>The forward guns of the <i>Colodia</i> might have
thrown shells into this launch, but such missiles
would have imperiled the lives of the people on
the <i>Susanne</i>.</p>

<p>The <i>Colodia’s</i> officers through their glasses
could see the remaining passengers and crew of
the sugar ship lined up against the rail under the
threatening rifles of the Germans. There was
considerable activity on the deck of the sinking
ship during the next few minutes.</p>

<p>The destroyer swerved in her course, her commander
hoping to get around the <i>Susanne</i> and
mark the position of the raider before the motor
launch could get away from the sinking ship. But
the Germans worked so quickly that this chance
was very small indeed. The destroyer was still
a long shot away from the exciting scene.</p>

<p>A number of men were seen staggering along
the deck of the sugar ship bearing some heavy
object. It was hoisted into the launch and then
the latter was lowered quickly into the sea, most
of the Germans scrambling down as best they
might.</p>

<p>“It’s the purser’s strong box!” shouted one of
the lookouts in the destroyer’s top. “And they
are going to shoot the poor guy, I bet, for not
giving up the combination!”</p>

<p>Other members of the <i>Colodia’s</i> company had
already observed a man’s figure, with his hands
tied behind him, standing at the farther rail of
the <i>Susanne</i>. The four last men from the raider’s
launch, all ready to descend into the boat, raised
their rifles and fired across the deck at the victim.
The man fell, and the murderers swarmed down
the rope into the launch.</p>

<p>All this the excited crew of the destroyer saw
while they were yet too far away to be of any
help. Commander Lang might have ordered his
guns to open fire; but the danger of hitting the
<i>Susanne</i> was too great.</p>

<p>The officer commanding the German launch
was too sharp to give the coming destroyer any
safe chance of making a hit without damaging
the sugar ship. He steered his motor-boat right
along the hull of the crippled <i>Susanne</i>, under the
shower of flaming débris that had begun to fall,
and went out of sight in a cloud of smoke that
had settled upon the sea.</p>

<p>This smoke offered a splendid bit of camouflage
for the raider and the launch. Up to this point
the lookouts in the destroyer’s tops had caught
no glimpse of the <i>Sea Pigeon</i>. She was a very
wary bird indeed!</p>

<p>The smoke cloud from the burning ship spread
across the sea and supplemented the fast dissolving
fog in hiding the German craft. But
suddenly a lookout hailed the <i>Colodia’s</i> quarter:</p>

<p>“Steamship’s top, sir! Six hundred yards
abaft the sinking ship, sir!”</p>

<p>Orders snapped to the forward gun crews.
They could see nothing but fog and smoke astern
of the <i>Susanne</i>; but their knowledge of elevation,
distance, and other gunnery lore, encouraged
them to hope for a “strike.”</p>

<p>The guns began to speak, and the shells shrieked
over the stern of the sinking steamship, exploding
somewhere in the smoke cloud. There followed
no shots in reply. The Germans were shy. The
thickening smoke shut out again all sight of the
<i>Sea Pigeon</i>.</p>

<p>The condition of the <i>Susanne</i> was threatening.
Commander Lang dared not consider a pursuit of
the German raider when lives were in such peril
here.</p>

<p>Two boats were all that had been put out from
the sugar ship. Her other small craft were
smashed by the shellfire of the raider.</p>

<p>Some forty or more people were gathered in
the bows of the <i>Susanne</i>, and they must needs be
taken off quickly. The big merchant vessel was
surely going down.</p>

<p>Her two boats had already pulled away to a
safe distance. Commander Lang would not risk
his own small craft near the trembling hull of the
<i>Susanne</i>, but swerved the course of the destroyer
that she might run in under the high bows of the
ill-fated ship.</p>

<p>Signals were passed, and the remaining members
of the <i>Susanne’s</i> crew hastened to prepare
slings in which to lower the passengers to the destroyer’s
deck.</p>

<p>“Volunteers to go up there and help those
people! Smart, now!” sang out the executive
officer of the <i>Colodia</i> through his trumpet.</p>

<p>Ikey Rosenmeyer and Frenchy Donahue, who
were both free, leaped forward at the call. With
Seven Knott and two other sailors, they swarmed
up to the high bows of the imperiled ship.</p>

<p>The two Seacove boys were well trained in the
uses of cordage and in knotting and splicing.
They seized a coil of rope and, working together
swiftly, safely lowered three women and a
wounded man over the rail to the destroyer’s
deck before they were piped down from the
<i>Susanne</i>.</p>

<p>Even the dead body of the murdered purser
was sent aboard the <i>Colodia</i>. The flames were
by that time surging upward, and it was almost
too hot to stand upon her forward decks. The
bows of the ship were being thrust up as her
stern sank. At any minute the wreck might
plunge beneath the sea.</p>

<p>“Back all!” rose a stentorian voice from the
destroyer.</p>

<p>Ikey and Frenchy went over the rail and
swarmed down their respective lines. They were
guided inboard to the firm deck of the destroyer.
The other workers followed. The <i>Colodia</i> backed
swiftly away.</p>

<p>Nor was this done a minute too soon. The
wreck was already wallowing from side to side
like some wounded monster of the sea. The air
pressure blew up the forward deck. Had the survivors
remained longer they would have been
overwhelmed!</p>

<p>A roaring like that of a great exhaust pipe
came from the interior of the sugar ship. The
sea began to seethe in a whirlpool about her. She
stood almost upright on her stern as she sank.</p>

<p>Down, down she went, while the destroyer
turned tail and scudded away at top speed. To be
caught in that whirlpool would have spelled disaster
for even as staunch a craft as the <i>Colodia</i>
undoubtedly was.</p>

<p>The <i>Susanne</i> disappeared slowly, with great
combers roaring about her. Beaten to a froth,
the waves leaped, white-maned, upon her tossing
sprit, and finally hid even that from sight. The
sea was a cauldron of boiling waters, and that
for hundreds of yards around.</p>

<p>The two boats that had escaped from the wreck
had been pulled far away. They were loaded
heavily, but were not at the time in any danger.
The <i>Colodia</i>, therefore, did not swing her nose in
their direction.</p>

<p>Instead, she was speeded into the rapidly thinning
smoke cloud which covered the sea astern of
the sugar ship. There the German raider was
somewhere hiding. It was possible that one of
the shells from the destroyer might have done her
some damage, or might even have struck the
motor launch.</p>

<p>These hopes were doomed to disappointment,
however. Five minutes after the <i>Susanne</i> was
utterly sunk, the smoke was so dissipated that the
lookouts on the destroyer could view the ocean
for miles about.</p>

<p>In the distance, and reeling off the knots at
most surprising speed, was a steam vessel that
could be naught else than the <i>Sea Pigeon</i>. She
had picked up her motor launch and escaped. The
<i>Colodia</i> might have followed and overhauled her
in a long chase; but she could not desert the two
boatloads of survivors from the sugar ship here
in the middle of the Atlantic.</p>

<p>The radio man was sending queries for help
for the survivors of the <i>Susanne</i>; but no ship
answered nearer than two hundred miles. It was
the first duty of the naval vessel to save the helpless,
and she could not fight the German pirates
and make these people comfortable, too.</p>

<p>So pursuit was abandoned, much to the
dissatisfaction of her crew, and the <i>Colodia</i> swung
around and approached the two open boats.
These, with their cargoes of human freight, were
picked up. Then the destroyer was headed into
the north, there to meet a Mediterranean-bound
steamship that would take off the <i>Susanne’s</i> castaways
and leave the naval vessel free again.</p>

<p>Of course the Navy Boys were vastly interested
in the experiences of the people from the sunken
ship. Few of her crew, and no passengers, had
been lost. When the boilers had blown up two
of the firemen were killed and several wounded.</p>

<p>The courageous purser who had refused to tell
the Germans the combination of the safe in his
office, was the only officer killed. In that safe
had been the wealth of several passengers. The
raider wanted gold more than anything else.</p>

<p>“Just like the pirates of old, I tell you,”
Frenchy said to his chums. “Those old fellows
used to make their captives walk the plank. Now
these Huns line ’em up and shoot them. I only
hope we catch and sink that <i>Sea Pigeon</i>, and
every German aboard of her!”</p>

<p>“Look out he doesn’t bite you, fellows,” advised
Al. “He’s got hydrophobia.”</p>

<p>But they all felt increased anger at the enemy
when they had talked with the survivors of the
<i>Susanne</i>. Their experience was enough to stir
the blood of any listener.</p>

<p>“That <i>Sea Pigeon</i> has got to be caught!” was
the assurance of the boys and men of the <i>Colodia’s</i>
crew.</p>

<p>The cruise, after this experience, was a much
more serious matter to them all than it had been
before. As far as the Seacove boys and Belding
went, it had become pretty serious in any case.
The prime reason for this lay in the message of
mystery that the radio men continued, at times,
to half catch out of the air.</p>

<p>George Belding confided to Sparks the name
Phil Morgan had made out of the uncertain letters
which the chief had written down after hearing
them repeated in his ear while at the radio
instrument. “Redbird”; that seemed plain enough.</p>

<p>“And the <i>Redbird</i> is the ship my folks and
Whistler’s sisters are sailing on to Bahia,” explained
Belding. “Why, she might be right out
yonder, not so many miles away,” and he pointed
into the west.</p>

<p>“You mean to say your sister can send Morse?”</p>

<p>“She used to be able to. She wasn’t quick or
accurate, but she could get a message over.”</p>

<p>“There is something altogether wrong with this
sending,” said the radio man thoughtfully.</p>

<p>“I know it, sir. She wouldn’t know any code.
She would probably spell out every letter and
word. We only get a part of what is sent. That
is, if it is Lilian who is doing this.”</p>

<p>“It is mighty interesting, this ‘ghost talk’,” the
chief said slowly. “I can see you are putting
altogether too much faith in the possibility that
the stuff is real. Why, we often get the most
inexplicable sounds out of the air! It is a very
long chance that this is a real message, or that
it is from your sister, George.”</p>

<p>“It’s a message from somebody and from
somewhere; and I’m awfully interested, too,” declared
Belding. “I wish you’d let me listen in
again.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I’ll do that little thing for you,” agreed
Sparks. “If there is nothing much doing in radio
in the afternoon watch, come around again.”</p>

<p>With this promise George Belding contented
himself. He told Whistler and the other boys
he was going to set down every letter of the mystery
message that he could comprehend, and see
afterward just what could be made out of them&mdash;sense
or nonsense!</p>


<h2 id='chXXII'>CHAPTER XXII&mdash;THE WIRELESS CALL FOR HELP</h2>


<p>Having delivered the survivors of the <i>Susanne</i>
to the greater comforts of an Italian liner bound
eastward, the <i>Colodia’s</i> own course was set for
the south and west. Her commander and crew
hoped to pick up news of the <i>Sea Pigeon</i> once
again. At any rate, the German raider had been
last seen making off toward the West Indies and
the Caribbean.</p>

<p>The destroyer was below the Tropic of Cancer
now, and the weather was exceedingly hot. A
dress of dungaree trousers and sleeveless undershirt
was the most popular uniform forward of
the bridge, decided Donahue.</p>

<p>“The brass hats who have to fairly live in their
uniforms are greatly to be pitied.”</p>

<p>Drills were not pushed, and many duties became
merely a matter of form.</p>

<p>Yet there was a very serious train of thought
in the minds of the Seacove boys and George
Belding, as has been shown. There had been uncertainty
enough regarding the voyage of the
<i>Redbird</i> to Bahia; but since the beginning of
what the radio men called the “ghost talk” out of
the air, the five friends had all felt a greater
measure of anxiety.</p>

<p>Of course, it was by no means certain that these
letters in Morse that suggested the name <i>Redbird</i>
had anything to do with Mr. Belding’s ship and
her company. Yet, not having heard in any form
from the party bound for Bahia since the ship left
New York, it was not strange that George Belding
and Phil Morgan, at least, should be especially
troubled in their minds.</p>

<p>During the afternoon watch on this day in
which George had gone to Mr. Sparks again, the
young fellow got relief and approached the radio
room. The chief was off duty and one of his
assistants was at the instrument. But the older
man was lolling in the doorway and welcomed
Belding with a smile.</p>

<p>“Jim, here,” said Sparks, nodding to the student
at the instrument, “was just telling me ‘ghost
talk’ is coming over again. He says he gets
‘Colodia’ as clear as can be.”</p>

<p>“My goodness! Then somebody is trying to
call us, Mr. Sparks!” murmured Belding.</p>

<p>“I don’t know. I’ve been keeping track, busy
as we have been for a couple of days. I really
think there is some attempt to put a message
over; but whether it is for fun or serious, I would
not dare state. Or whether it is meant for us or
not. It isn’t the same message each time.”</p>

<p>“But you do believe that somebody is trying&mdash;or
something?”</p>

<p>“‘Something’ is good,” growled Sparks. “I’ve
made out ‘Colodia’ more than a few times myself.
And I agree that the letters you caught the last
time you were listening in, and which I heard
myself, may spell ‘Redbird’. Then, you know,
you said you heard ‘help.’”</p>

<p>“Well, I did!” snorted Belding.</p>

<p>The radio chief pushed a square bit of paper
into his hand. On it were set down without
spacing of any kind the following line of letters:</p>

<blockquote>
“c,o,l,o,d,i,a,h,e,l,p,r,e,d,b,i,r,d,l,b.”
</blockquote>

<p>“I will be honest with you, George,” he said,
watching closely the flushing face of the youth.
“I really got those letters not half an hour ago.
They were repeated in just that order several
times. What do you make out of them?”</p>

<p>Belding’s excitement was growing momentarily.
He seized Sparks’ pencil and wrote under the
row of letters swiftly and surely:</p>

<blockquote>
“Colodia&mdash;Help&mdash;Redbird&mdash;L.B.”
</blockquote>

<p>The chief nodded. “‘L. B.’ being your sister’s
initials, eh?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” cried George breathlessly. “Lilian
Belding.”</p>

<p>“Get over there on the bench. Jim will give
you the harness. Listen in and see what you can
make of it now,” said Sparks, himself excited.</p>

<p>George slid on to the bench and Jim handed
him the receivers and strap. The youth fitted the
discs to his ears, settled himself on the seat, and
opened the key. As usual the static sputtered in
the receivers for a little. He tuned down to the
short waves and the strange, grating sounds began.</p>

<p>It was very bad Morse&mdash;clumsy and irregular;
but that it was Morse, Belding was confident.
There was something wrong either with the
sender or with the instrument sending.</p>

<p>Belding seized the pad of scratch paper and
poised his pencil. For a few moments the “ghost
talk” ceased. Was it all over for the time? He
waited impatiently, growing hot and cold with
nervousness.</p>

<p>There were plenty of other wave-sounds in the
air, had he cared to listen to them. But he knew
the monotonous and rasping letters&mdash;on a lower
plane, even, than the commercial waves&mdash;were
carried only at the level to which he had tuned
the instrument.</p>

<p>Suddenly: “<i>Colodia! Colodia! Colodia!</i>”</p>

<p>The words were rapped out harshly but briskly&mdash;each
letter plainly to be read. Then Belding
began to set down the unevenly sent letters as he
could make them out, with a dash where he failed
to catch the letter intended:</p>

<p class='long-string'>“c,o,l,o,d,i,a,h,e,l,p,g,e,t,&mdash;,a,n,&mdash;,s,&mdash;,i,z,&mdash;,d,r,e,d,b,i,r,d,&mdash;,o,r,b,&mdash;,&mdash;,i,a,h,e,l,p,l,b,e,l,d,i,&mdash;,&mdash;.”
</p>

<p>George could not stop then to see whether these
letters made any sense or not. He believed the
main trouble with the message was that the sender
used no punctuation.</p>

<p>For a brief time the mystery ceased. Then
again the sounds broke out&mdash;the same clumsy,
uncertain Morse; so bad, indeed, that at first the
listener could make out a letter only now and
then:</p>

<p class='long-string'>
“l,&mdash;,&mdash;,&mdash;,&mdash;,l,&mdash;,n,g,&mdash;,&mdash;,&mdash;,a,&mdash;,e,r,e,&mdash;,b,i,r,&mdash;,&mdash;,a,i,n,&mdash;,e,d,&mdash;,&mdash;,t,m,&mdash;,&mdash;,t,i,n,&mdash;,g,e,r,&mdash;,&mdash;,n,s,s,e,i,z,e,d,s,&mdash;,i,&mdash;h,e,l,p.”
</p>

<p>There was silence again as far as the “ghost
talk” was concerned. Belding waited with his
pencil poised over the paper.</p>

<p>His eyes meanwhile scanned the first list of
letters he had set down. At first glance he believed
he made out the first three words in the
message. They were, “Colodia,help,get.” After
the break and several disconnected letters the
word “redbird” fairly leaped at him from the
page. Then, after a few misses and letters that
made no sense, he got “help” again. Then he
saw as clear as day: “L.Belding”&mdash;his sister’s
signature!</p>

<p>“Colodia&mdash;help&mdash;get&mdash;Redbird&mdash;help&mdash;L.Belding.”</p>

<p>The young fellow shook all over as he sat there
before the radio instrument. This was a message
from his sister, Lilian. Nothing could thereafter
shake his belief in this statement. And that she
and the <i>Redbird</i> were in peril Belding was positive.</p>

<p>The second combination of letters offered fewer
understandable words than the first, or so it
seemed to Belding at that moment. The beginning
of this second message was entirely indistinguishable,
but toward the end he got two words
complete&mdash;“seized” and “help.”</p>

<p>Altogether he was assured that he had guessed
the main trouble with the sender of these strange
messages. The words were all run together and
the awkward and uneven sending made the unpunctuated
words very hard to understand.</p>

<p>Sparks touched him on the shoulder. He had
a paper in his hand that a messenger had just
brought. It was a radio that must be sent at once.</p>

<p>“Let me at it for a minute, son,” the radio chief
said. “Here’s a report for headquarters’ base.
Did you get anything?”</p>

<p>“I&mdash;I don’t know,” murmured George, giving
place to the man. He left the room, taking with
him the paper on which he had penciled the broken
messages.</p>

<p>Secretly he was confident that he had heard a
call over the radio for help and that his sister
Lilian, on the <i>Redbird</i>, was sending it.</p>

<p>He wanted to see Philip Morgan about it&mdash;to
show the leader of the Seacove Navy Boys this
paper with the two cryptograms he had picked
out of the air. Like Al Torrance, Ikey Rosenmeyer,
and Frenchy Donahue, George had come
by this time to look upon Phil Morgan as a fellow
of parts. Phil would be able to help him make
these messages out, if anybody could!</p>

<p>But he could have no time with Whistler until
second dog watch that evening. Then he got the
Seacove youth aside and showed him what he
had managed to set down in letters from the
“ghost talk” he had listened in on that afternoon.</p>

<p>Whistler did not know a thing about Morse, or
much about radio, but he had a sharp eye and a
clear head. Belding had translated enough words
of both messages to suggest the general trend of
them.</p>

<p>“How do you know where the letters ‘break’
if you can’t hear all the dots and dashes?” Whistler
first asked, scanning the paper seriously. “That
appears curious to me.”</p>

<p>“Not in this case. If it is Lil sending&mdash;or
whoever it is&mdash;the sender is so unfamiliar with
the Morse American code that there is a hesitation
between the letters. Why, I thought at first
the message was in Continental code, which is,
you know, entirely different from American.”</p>

<p>“It’s all news to me, old boy. Go on.”</p>

<p>“Why, there’s nothing more. If I could hear
those words repeated several times I reckon I’d
get most of the letters&mdash;and get them straight.”</p>

<p>“I see,” murmured his friend. “And as it is,
you have got a good many of the words, only
you haven’t noticed it.”</p>

<p>“What’s that?”</p>

<p>“Why, it is plain,” said Whistler, “that several
of the same words are used in both messages.”</p>

<p>“Yes. ‘Help’, ‘<i>Colodia</i>’, ‘<i>Redbird</i>’.”</p>

<p>“More than those,” said Whistler. “See! You
have ‘seized’ plain as the nose on your face in
the second set of letters.”</p>

<p>“I see that.”</p>

<p>“And there it is in the first list,” and Whistler
pointed as he spoke to a combination of letters
and blanks almost immediately following “Colodia&mdash;Help&mdash;Get.”
“There is ‘s-e-i-z-ed’, plain
enough. And, yes, by Jove! There is ‘redbird’
in the second message. Look here, old man! Let
me go through this.”</p>

<p>“That is what I want you to do,” responded
Belding excitedly.</p>

<p>“In the beginning the message surely says:
‘Colodia! Help! Get!&mdash;&mdash;No! That should not
be ‘getmans’ that ‘seized Redbird’. No, no!
There is the same combination in the lower message.
It is ‘ger’ down there, not ‘get’,” muttered
Whistler, vastly interested now.</p>

<p>With pencil and paper he set to work. In five
minutes he offered Belding the following paragraph
as a translation in full of the first message:</p>

<p>“Colodia! Help! Germans seized Redbird for
Bahia. Help!&mdash;L. Belding.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Whistler, you’ve got it! And it is as we
have feared. Those papers that Emil Eberhardt
stole from me back in England have played the
dickens with the <i>Redbird</i> and the folks. I am
sure it is Lil trying to call me&mdash;the splendid kid
that she is!”</p>

<p>“Hold on! Hold on!” Whistler said, but encouragingly.
“Let’s get the other message, too.”</p>

<p>He set to work on that; but the first of it baffled
him. He could only begin to make it out where
the word “Redbird” occurred. From that place
on, it was not so difficult: “Redbird painted out&mdash;mutiny&mdash;Germans
seized ship&mdash;Help.” This
second message was not signed with Lilian Belding’s
name or her initials, but George knew the
sending to have been the same as that of the first
call for help.</p>

<p>“But, Phil!” gasped the New York youth,
“we don’t know a living thing about where the
<i>Redbird</i> is, or what is happening to our folks.”</p>

<p>“You’d think she would have tried to tell their
situation in the message,” rejoined Whistler slowly.</p>

<p>“If she knew. She’s a girl, and wouldn’t be
likely to interest herself much in navigation.”</p>

<p>“Tut, tut, my boy! Everybody at sea takes an
interest in the course of the ship and her speed.
Of course they do. Wait! Here is the abbreviation
for longitude right here&mdash;‘long.’ Two
blanks for the figures you did not catch, George,
my boy!”</p>

<p>“Do you think so?” murmured his friend.</p>

<p>Whistler wrote it “Lat.&mdash;,&mdash;, long.&mdash;,&mdash;.”
Then he had an inspiration and put in “name”
before “Redbird.”</p>

<p>“There we have it in full&mdash;except for the figures
of the <i>Redbird’s</i> position. Look out for
them next time, George. They are important.”</p>

<p>“Next time, Morgan?” gasped George Belding,
excitedly.</p>

<p>“Certainly. It stands to reason your sister is
sending out messages for help whenever she gets
a chance at the radio instrument on the <i>Redbird</i>.
And take it from me, the most important thing
she is trying to put over is the position of the ship
from day to day. They take the sun at noon, and
as soon afterward as she can, Lilian gets to the
radio and sends that information into the air.</p>

<p>“Believe me, George, you have some smart
sister, and no mistake!” said Whistler Morgan in
much admiration.</p>


<h2 id='chXXIII'>CHAPTER XXIII&mdash;THE SEA PIGEON IN SIGHT</h2>


<p>George Belding was for running right off to
the radio chief, Mr. Sparks, to ask another chance
to listen in on the wireless for further messages
from the <i>Redbird</i>. The supposition that Germans
in her crew had mutinied and seized his father’s
ship became at once a certainty in George’s mind.</p>

<p>Whistler, however, with his usual cautiousness,
steadied his friend.</p>

<p>“There is no use making such an application
now, George,” he said. “There will be none of
this ‘ghost-talk’ in the air at this hour.”</p>

<p>“Oh!”</p>

<p>“You know, they only hear those messages in
the afternoon watch. That is the only time, in
all probability, that your sister can get to the
radio. The rest of the time, perhaps, the regular
radio man is on duty, and he is probably in league
with the mutineers.”</p>

<p>“My goodness, Phil!” ejaculated Belding, “that
word ‘mutineers’ makes me tremble.”</p>

<p>“It suggests the rough stuff, all right,” agreed
the Seacove lad. “I hope my sisters and your
folks will not be treated too outrageously by the
gang that has got possession of your father’s
ship.”</p>

<p>“If we could only find them! We’re tied here
on this old iron pot&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Hold on! Don’t malign the <i>Colodia</i>. We
may be glad for their sakes that we are on this
destroyer.”</p>

<p>“I don’t see it. I wish I was on the <i>Redbird</i>.”</p>

<p>“A fat chance! With those Germans committing
acts of barratry like painting out the
<i>Redbird’s</i> name! That shows they are desperate
men. And what could we do to them if we were
in their power?”</p>

<p>“What help can we give the folks from this
distance?” groaned Belding.</p>

<p>“This is a matter that will have to be brought
to the attention of the Old Man, George. I am
going to speak to Mr. MacMasters and ask him
to get us a chance to interview Commander
Lang.”</p>

<p>“Will he listen to us, do you think?”</p>

<p>“Of course he will,” said Whistler with confidence.</p>

<p>The two friends could scarcely sleep in their
watch below, and in the morning their anxiety
was apparent to the other boys.</p>

<p>Whistler watched for his chance and spoke to
Ensign MacMasters. The ensign would do anything
within reason for Whistler and his friends.
He considered the four Seacove lads about the
finest boys aboard the <i>Colodia</i>.</p>

<p>Upon hearing the story of the mystery message
he became vastly interested. He went to see
Sparks first of all, and then hurried to Commander
Lang’s cabin. One reason why Mr. MacMasters
was so eager to see the commander was
because Sparks had told him that during the
previous evening an operator at the Weather
Bureau station at Arlington, Virginia, had asked
the <i>Colodia’s</i> chief radio man:</p>

<p>“Have you caught message being put out for
<i>Colodia</i>?”</p>

<p>While a radio man on the troopship <i>Kinkadia</i>
demanded:</p>

<p>“Anybody named Belding on <i>Colodia</i>? He appears
to be wanted by a ham.”</p>

<p>Which was not a very respectful way of referring
to George’s sister. It showed, however,
that Lilian’s uncertain sending was attracting attention
at several points.</p>

<p>It was mid-forenoon before the two friends
were called into the presence of Commander
Lang. Belding was bashful and allowed Whistler
to do most of the talking. And he was impressed
by the ease and coolness with which his friend
went about the matter.</p>

<p>Commander Lang met Phil Morgan as he
would have met another man. There was nothing
“kiddish about Whistler,” Al had once said. The
commander of the <i>Colodia</i> examined the messages
as the boys believed they were intended to read.
He at once approved the application of George
Belding to be attached to the radio squad until
further notice. He sent for Sparks and heard
his story of the mystery message. In every way
he showed an acute interest in the affair.</p>

<p>If the <i>Redbird</i> was somewhere at sea in charge
of mutineers&mdash;Germans at that!&mdash;to find her
would be a task for the <i>Colodia</i>. But as Whistler
had immediately seen, it was agreed that to discover
the course of the <i>Redbird</i> and her daily
position by the sun were the most important
points.</p>

<p>The boys were most impatient for the time
to come when George would take his “trick” at
the radio instrument again. This would not be
until the afternoon watch, when the radio man
then on duty had orders to give the instrument
over to George if the “ghost-talk” again was heard.</p>

<p>It had been decided that George should try to
reply to the mysterious call. By spelling out the
name of his father’s ship, the <i>Redbird</i>, or calling
Lilian Belding by name, it might be possible to
communicate with the vessel and send a word of
courage to the passengers. The desire was to
encourage the sender of the strange message to
repeat again and again the <i>Redbird’s</i> situation.</p>

<p>It was only possible to guess at the course of
the ship bound for Bahia, as well as her present
position. Lilian Belding had doubtless called for
the <i>Colodia</i> because her brother and Whistler
Morgan served on that naval vessel, not because
she had any idea as to where the destroyer was.</p>

<p>The two vessels might be a desperately long
distance apart. That fact could not be overlooked.
The boys were in a fever of expectation.</p>

<p>As it drew near eight bells of the forenoon
watch there came a message by wireless that was
even more exciting for most of the crew than the
mystery of the “ghost-talk.”</p>

<p>“An S O S!” whispered the messenger to
George Belding as he darted from the radio station
to the bridge.</p>

<p>Swiftly the watch officer read the message:
“H. M. S. S. <i>Ferret</i>, from Porto Rico for Liverpool,
attacked by German cruiser <i>Sea Pigeon</i>, lat.
twenty-one, long. fifty-eight. S O S.”</p>

<p>The exciting information was instantly communicated
two ways&mdash;to the commander’s cabin
and to the chief engineer. The <i>Colodia</i> leaped
forward, conned on her new course at once. They
were off in another race to overtake the elusive
German raider&mdash;and this time, perhaps, to find
her.</p>

<p>“But we may be going right away from the
<i>Redbird</i>!” Belding complained to the other boys.</p>

<p>“On the other hand, we don’t know but it may
be taking us right toward your father’s vessel,”
Whistler said, trying to comfort his friend.</p>

<p>He felt worried himself about it. There would
be no chance to try to reach the <i>Redbird</i> by radio
during the afternoon watch. Whistler was just
as anxious as Belding; only he kept these feelings
much more to himself.</p>

<p>The radio sparked message after message to
and from the British ship. The <i>Colodia</i> was the
only naval craft within possible reach of the spot
from which the call came, although there were
both British cruisers and torpedo boats on the
Bermuda and Bahama stations.</p>

<p>But they were heavy craft, and it would have
taken days for a boat from either station to reach
the point indicated by the <i>Ferret</i>. Whereas, with
good fortune, the American destroyer’s engines
would drive her to the spot in three hours.</p>

<p>Could the British merchant vessel keep up the
unequal fight for that length of time? The German
must have already engaged her, or the radio
message from the <i>Ferret</i> as first transmitted
would not have been so exact.</p>

<p>From out of the air came messages from all
directions urging the <i>Colodia</i> on. The <i>Ferret’s</i>
S O S and the destroyer’s answer had been picked
up by both ship and land stations. Ships long out
of range, it would seem, became interested in the
attempt to “get” the raider which had already
cut such a swath among shipping in the Atlantic.</p>

<p>Remembering the fate of the <i>Susanne</i>, the crew
of the <i>Colodia</i> had some reason for believing that
this dash of the good destroyer was a “long shot.”
It seemed scarcely possible that she would arrive
at the scene of the fight in time to save the merchant
ship from complete disaster.</p>

<p>Yet the radio messages were encouraging.
After an hour the <i>Ferret</i> reported no serious damage
done and that they had put two shells aboard
their pursuer from their well-manned deck guns.</p>

<p>“Well done, <i>Ferret</i>!” flashed the destroyer’s
radio. “Keep up the good work.”</p>

<p>Yet every moment it was expected aboard the
<i>Colodia</i> that either the wireless on the steamship
would be destroyed, or she would report serious
injury to her machinery. The raider would, of
course, strive to place her shells where they would
utterly cripple her victim&mdash;either under the stern
and smash the propellers, or amidships and burst
boilers or wreck engines.</p>

<p>The <i>Colodia’s</i> crew were ordered to stations,
more for the sake of keeping order on deck than
for aught else. Every man who could be spared
from below was ranged along the decks. Gun
covers were removed, breech blocks looked to, and
every man was keyed to a high pitch.</p>

<p>“Talk about efficiency!” growled Ensign
MacMasters. “We’ve <i>got</i> it. Just because the Germans
have been abusing the word is no reason
why we should not properly use it. They are
often efficient to a useless end; but we’ll show
that sea-raider, if we get a chance, that the old
<i>Colodia</i> is more efficient than a German ever
dared be!”</p>

<p>The destroyer plowed on and on, while every
minute that elapsed without their hearing that
the <i>Ferret</i> was wrecked encouraged hope. Now
and again word came that the British ship, with
dogged persistency, was holding out. She had
been hit now several times, and the <i>Sea Pigeon</i>
was reported as being almost on top of her. Still
she was providentially saved from disaster.</p>

<p>Through the heat of a tropical noontide the
destroyer rushed on toward the fight. The crew
looked for no shelter now, they only desired to
see the smoke of the guns ahead.</p>

<p>And before six bells of the afternoon watch
they had the desire of their eyes! The lookouts
began to yell the glad tidings to the bridge, and
the crew took up the news with a mighty shout.</p>

<p>The wind was against their hearing the guns
at first, but finally the thundering roll of the
weapons reached the ears of the Americans. The
<i>Colodia</i> seemed to increase her speed. The smoke
rolled back from her stacks and lay flat along the
sea as though painted there with one stroke of a
giant brush.</p>

<p>Within a few minutes they could see balloons
of smoke billowing up ahead, but these were from
no ship afire. They were the announcement of
gun discharges.</p>

<p>On the destroyer tore through the quiet sea.
The lookouts hailed for the upperworks of the
<i>Ferret</i>. Another message came by radio that the
attacked steamship had seen and hailed with delight
her rescuer.</p>

<p>The explosion of the guns ahead brought joy
to the hearts of the <i>Colodia’s</i> crew. There was
the prospect of a real fight! The smoke of the
raider was announced. The destroyer’s course
was swerved ever so slightly that she might pass
the battered <i>Ferret</i> and draw the fire of the German
from the merchant ship.</p>

<p>Then the order was given, and her own guns
began to speak. It was at long range, but the
marksmanship of American gun crews had become
really wonderful. The high, shrieking shells
sought out the German ship, and within the first
dozen sent over, the radio man on the <i>Ferret</i> reported
a “strike.” One of the <i>Sea Pigeon’s</i>
smokestacks was carried away!</p>

<p>The fight was on. The Americans hoped to get
near enough to the German boat to bring her to
terms within a very short time.</p>


<h2 id='chXXIV'>CHAPTER XXIV&mdash;THE BLIND CHASE</h2>


<p>The excitement of the dash for the embattling
ships left the <i>Colodia’s</i> company no thought for
anything else. Even dinner had been half-neglected,
although that came early in the race.</p>

<p>As for weather indications or the like, nobody
thought of such things. And here suddenly appeared
a phenomenon that bade fair to help the
Germans and place the destroyer in a less confident
position.</p>

<p>The American ship had arrived just in time to
save the <i>Ferret</i>; her upperworks were badly
wrecked although providentially the wireless outfit
of the British ship was not crippled.</p>

<p>One of her guns was put out of commission
and a shell under the stern had knocked out the
propeller just as the Colodia entered the fight.
She swung now to the slow current, and as the
destroyer rushed past her the British crew could
only cheer her on. Their work was done&mdash;and
done well!</p>

<p>But here came a cloud rolling along the surface
of the sea from the south that offered shelter for
the raider, the prow of which was already turned
in that direction. The German had no intention
of remaining to fight the battle out with the guns
of the destroyer.</p>

<p>The raider was not, of course, any match for
the American naval vessel. It was the part of
wisdom for her to run. Besides, she was already
crippled, and it would have been but a matter of
a few minutes before she would either have to
capitulate or be sunk had she continued in the
fight. The <i>Colodia</i> might even have kept out of
range of the raider’s guns, circled about the German,
and destroyed her at pleasure. Or she could
have sent a torpedo against the pirate ship and
blown her to bits.</p>

<p>Here, however, fortune helped the enemy. The
cloud of fog laid along the surface of the sea
offered the <i>Sea Pigeon</i> refuge. She proved again
that she was a “wary bird!”</p>

<p>Into the cloud she dashed, and where she went
after that&mdash;although the fog bank was low&mdash;the
lookouts of the <i>Colodia</i> could not tell.</p>

<p>“If we only had a hydroplane to send up!” said
Whistler Morgan to his chums. “The time will
come when every destroyer will have its pair of
hydroplanes for observation. From a thousand
feet up, that fog would never shelter the raider.
The hydroplane could signal us the raider’s position
and we’d follow her just as though it were
clear weather.”</p>

<p>In this case, however, the commander of the
destroyer did not wish to desert the <i>Ferret</i> until
he had learned her condition. The <i>Colodia</i> described
a wide circle and steamed back within
hailing distance of the crippled British ship.</p>

<p>Fortunately there were no women or other
passengers aboard this vessel. Her wounded were
few, too. The hull of the craft had not suffered.
Already her machinists were at work on the propeller.
They had new blades in the hold, and the
end of the shaft was not injured. They proposed
to sweat on the new propeller, make such other
repairs as were necessary, and then attempt to
limp into the Bermuda station under her own
steam.</p>

<p>“You can’t beat those fellows!” said Ensign
MacMasters admiringly. “The merchant sailors
nowadays have more to face than we do, and
with less chance of getting safely out of a scrimmage.
I wouldn’t want to be hobbling along in
that cripple to the Bermudas with that German
pirate in the vicinity.”</p>

<p>Just where the <i>Sea Pigeon</i> had gone behind the
fog they could only surmise. But Commander
Lang ordered a course south by west, hoping that
the raider would turn up again.</p>

<p>Phil Morgan and George Belding had time to
think of the <i>Redbird</i> and her precious freight
once more. It was little satisfaction for either to
know that Sparks and his assistants were on the
lookout for messages from the sailing ship.</p>

<p>Nothing came up that night to give the anxious
boys any satisfaction. Sparks reported nothing
in the morning. But as the hour drew near when
the mysterious messages usually came over, both
Belding and Whistler Morgan hung about the
door of the radio room.</p>

<p>The radio chief knew just how anxious they
were and he did not scold them. Soon after
dinner he sent George to the bench to try to pick
up the uncertain sounds that he believed came
from the <i>Redbird’s</i> wireless.</p>

<p>George could only get a letter now and then.
The sending&mdash;if it was it&mdash;was weaker than before.
In desperation the youth began to send
himself:</p>

<p>“I,I,I, (aye,aye,aye) Colodia!”</p>

<p>He repeated this over and over again. An hour
passed before he got what seemed to be a direct
answer. Then:</p>

<p>“Colodia! Help! Redbird!”</p>

<p>Belding fairly shouted aloud in his excitement.
But when he turned to see Mr. Sparks and the
others at the door watching him, he subsided and
began to send calmly:</p>

<p>“Give position! Give position! Redbird, give
position!”</p>

<p>This went on for some time, and then he caught
the grating and uncertain sound of what he was
confident was his sister’s sending. He tuned his
instrument up and down the scale before getting
the best adjustment. Out of the air he finally
received letters which he wrote down falteringly
and passed to Mr. Sparks and Whistler. While
the message was being repeated the radio man
and Phil Morgan made out the following
paragraph:</p>

<p>“Ship Redbird for Bahia seized by German
mutineers. Position, lat. 17, long. 59. Help!&mdash;L.
Belding.”</p>

<p>“It’s Lilian, all right! Hurray!” exclaimed
Whistler, and Belding heard him.</p>

<p>The latter was now repeating, again and again,
the announcement that the <i>Colodia</i> heard the message
and was coming. Sparks hurried away to
seek Commander Lang with the news. The position
of the sailing ship was within easy reach of
the destroyer.</p>

<p>But the messages stopped suddenly. Not another
word came from the <i>Redbird</i>. Belding
came away from the instrument at last, feeling
anything but hopeful.</p>

<p>“Something’s happened to her,” he whispered
to Morgan. “I fear Lilian has got into trouble
by her work at the <i>Redbird’s</i> wireless. What do
you think, Phil?”</p>

<p>“I am not going to lose hope. We will find
the ship and rescue our folks from the mutineers.
Don’t doubt it, George!”</p>

<p>It was difficult to keep up their courage, however,
when there was so much uncertainty regarding
the sailing ship’s condition. It might be, too,
that the latitude and longitude was several points
off. A full degree is sixty miles, and sixty miles
is a long way across the ocean!</p>

<p>Just before dark they raised the smoke of a
steamer ahead and sailing athwart the destroyer’s
course. This surely could not be the <i>Redbird</i>;
yet the destroyer could not allow the stranger to
pass without investigation.</p>

<p>Her radio could get no answer from the ship.
It seemed as though the stranger was running
away from the <i>Colodia</i>. Naturally suspicion was
aroused in the minds of the commander that it
was the <i>Sea Pigeon</i>.</p>

<p>But it became a blind chase as night fell upon
them. They saw no lights, and the tropical night
comes so suddenly that to have overtaken the
steamship before dark was an utter impossibility.
The destroyer swung back into her direct course
for the point from which the last radio message
of the <i>Redbird</i> was supposed to have come.</p>


<h2 id='chXXV'>CHAPTER XXV&mdash;A NEW CONVOY</h2>


<p>At dawn, while a light fog still overspread the
sea, the crash of distant guns was brought to the
ears of the watch on duty. From what direction
the reports came it was impossible for the <i>Colodia’s</i>
officers to determine.</p>

<p>It was still too dark for the lookouts to make
out anything at a distance, even had the morning
been perfectly clear. But all hands were aroused,
the word running from deck to deck that the destroyer
was within sound of a naval action of
some kind.</p>

<p>It was not a signal gun they heard, for several
shots were fired simultaneously. Then there was
silence again. The <i>Colodia</i> sped on her course,
the hope being expressed by all that “blind luck,”
if nothing else, might lead her to the scene.</p>

<p>Just before the sun rose above the sea line the
lookouts began to shout their discoveries. Out
of the fog, but at a great distance, they saw the
upper spars and canvas of a great sailing ship.
The <i>Colodia’s</i> direction was changed to run closer
to this vessel.</p>

<p>“It’s a chance we have found her,” murmured
Whistler to George Belding. “She is square
rigged, and she is some ship in size, believe me!”</p>

<p>For, moment by moment, the fog was thinning
and the outlines of the spars and sails became
clearer. From the deck of the destroyer these
became visible.</p>

<p>The excitement of the Seacove boys and George
Belding was quite overpowering. That their
friends aboard the <i>Redbird</i> were in the hands of
mutineers they were assured; and now the guns,
which began to speak again, forewarned of added
peril!</p>

<p>As the sun came out they saw that the upper
canvas of the ship they had sighted was being
furled. Sail after sail disappeared. It was as
though she was being stripped of her canvas.</p>

<p>“She’s under the guns of that raider, I’ll bet a
cent!” declared Al Torrance. “So she has had to
stop her headway. Those guns were for the purpose
of making the ship&mdash;whoever she is&mdash;lie to.”</p>

<p>“But if it is the <i>Redbird</i>, the Germans already
have command of her,” cried Belding.</p>

<p>“We don’t know who she is yet,” said Whistler.</p>

<p>“Oi, oi!” gasped Ikey Rosenmeyer, “I’m so
excited yet I can’t keep still. Isn’t it <i>great</i>,
Frenchy?”</p>

<p>“Sure, it’s the greatest experience we’ve had,”
admitted the Irish lad. “For we don’t know
whether we are approaching friend or foe.”</p>

<p>Nor was the destroyer’s approach visible to
those aboard the sailing ship for some time. Her
color and the gray fog that lingered on the surface
of the sea aided in this.</p>

<p>There were no more guns for a time, but it was
quite evident that the sailing vessel had lost much
headway. It was then that the lookouts in the
tops of the <i>Colodia</i> first glimpsed the ship that
had fired the guns. She was a steamer coming
rapidly up on the course of the sailing vessel.</p>

<p>Two more guns were fired, but the shells seemed
not to have burst near the victim of the outrage.
They were meant merely as a threat. The sailing
craft which was nearer to the destroyer was
observed to be signaling with flags. The signals
were in a code that the signalmen of the <i>Colodia</i>
did not know, and they so reported to Commander
Lang.</p>

<p>“The Huns aboard the <i>Redbird</i> are signaling to
the Huns on the <i>Sea Pigeon</i>,” was the confident
declaration of prophetic Al Torrance.</p>

<p>“If it is so, you can just believe that they are
telling the raider of our approach. They must
see the <i>Colodia</i> coming now,” Whistler observed.</p>

<p>Suddenly, with the sun’s round face appearing
above the sea line, the last wisps of fog were
whipped away. The tropical heat burned up the
moisture in a flash.</p>

<p>“Boats at the davits of the ship now being
manned, sir!” came the hail from one of the destroyer’s
lookouts.</p>

<p>“They are abandoning ship!” was the word
passed along the decks.</p>

<p>“If it is the <i>Redbird</i>!” murmured Belding to
Phil Morgan, “what do you suppose will happen
to my father and mother and the girls?”</p>

<p>Whistler had no answer ready. He kept his
lips shut grimly and stared straight ahead.</p>

<p>The distance of the destroyer from the steamer
believed to be the German raider, was too great
as yet for a shot to be tried. They were near
enough to the sailing ship to see two boats
launched before it was considered well to use the
guns.</p>

<p>Then the <i>Colodia</i> sent her first shells close to
the boats that were being rowed toward the steam
craft.</p>

<p>“There are only men in those lifeboats,” declared
Ensign MacMasters, who had been examining
the distant specks through powerful glasses.
“It looks as though the mutineers had abandoned
ship and passengers and were attempting to join
their fellow countrymen aboard the <i>Sea Pigeon</i>.”</p>

<p>Immediately the commander ordered shells to
be dropped between the small boats and the
steamer, and the long distance guns began to
crack at the raider over the heads of the escaping
mutineers.</p>

<p>With her smoke trailing behind her and the
guns barking in rapid succession, the <i>Colodia</i>
raced toward the scene. She kept well away from
the sailing craft, but she drove on in a way to
cut off the two rowboats from the raider.</p>

<p>That it was the <i>Sea Pigeon</i>, nobody aboard the
destroyer now doubted.</p>

<p>“We’re going to kill two birds with one stone,
boys!” declared Ensign MacMasters cheerfully to
the Navy Boys. “I’ll bet that sailing ship is the
one your friends are aboard.”</p>

<p>His cheerfulness did not wholly overcome
George Belding’s depression. George was now
worrying as to what had been done to the passengers
of the <i>Redbird</i> before the mutineers left the
sailing ship!</p>

<p>That she was his father’s vessel he was confident.
Her rig was familiar to him.</p>

<p>As the destroyer drew nearer, too, her crew
saw certain figures on the deck of the sailing
vessel that seemed to be wildly signaling the naval
craft. Just then the <i>Colodia</i> could not stop to
investigate. Her work was to settle first with
the Germans.</p>

<p>The raider had finally started away from the
vicinity, leaving the crews of the two boats to
shift for themselves. It was her only chance for
escape, for the destroyer could outsteam the <i>Sea
Pigeon</i>, fast as she was.</p>

<p>A fortunate shot knocked away the jury smokestack
which had been put in place of the one the
destroyer had previously smashed. Interior damage
was done by this shell, too. This was immediately
apprehended by the raider’s movements.</p>

<p>“Hold fire!” commanded the executive officer
of the <i>Colodia</i>. Signals were sent up ordering
the German to surrender. Almost at once a white
ensign was displayed, and at the sight of it the
destroyer’s crew went mad with excitement.</p>

<p>Better than merely sinking the <i>Sea Pigeon</i>&mdash;they
had captured her! Their work of five weeks
at sea, away from their base, had ended gloriously.
The raider doubtless had a valuable
cargo, and the fact that she would be put out
of commission was a heavy blow to the German
arms.</p>

<p>Swiftly the destroyer approached and, at a certain
distance, sent a boat off to the <i>Sea Pigeon</i>
to bring her captain and a part of her force aboard
the American ship. But Commander Lang, understanding
fully the anxiety of Phil Morgan and
George Belding, ordered another motor boat
launched and allowed them to be members of her
crew. She was sent directly to the sailing ship
which now lay about two miles away.</p>

<p>Passing the two lifeboats, Ensign MacMasters,
who was in command of the launch, questioned
briefly their frightened crews. At first they
denied that they were mutineers. They declared
the raider had commanded them to abandon their
ship and row aboard the <i>Sea Pigeon</i>.</p>

<p>But when they were asked the name of the sailing
ship, and other pertinent queries, the sailors
broke down. All but their leader.</p>

<p>Suddenly George Belding uttered an exclamation
of surprise.</p>

<p>“Phil! Phil Morgan!” he shouted, forgetting
in his excitement to address their commanding
officer. “Don’t you know that fellow steering the
second boat?”</p>

<p>“I see him,” returned Whistler. “I&mdash;I <i>do</i> know
him! Mr. MacMasters! That is the spy from
the Zeppelin we told you about!”</p>

<p>“Emil Eberhardt, I do believe,” murmured
Belding. “It’s no wonder things went wrong
aboard the <i>Redbird</i> when that scoundrel was able
to cross the ocean and join her crew.”</p>

<p>No further information could be obtained from
the mutineers at that time. They were quite helpless,
and could only row on to the destroyer and
give themselves up as commanded.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the motor launch ran alongside the
big, square-rigged ship. Three girls at the rail
shrieked their delight at sight of Whistler and
George Belding. The latter’s father and mother
likewise appeared as the boys, following Mr. MacMasters,
went up the ladder which had been left
hanging over the side when the mutineers abandoned
the ship.</p>

<p>The Germans had carried away Mr. Belding’s
money&mdash;and it was a great sum&mdash;in the lifeboats;
but they dared not throw it overboard and so,
later, it was recovered. Otherwise the mutineers
had done little damage, nor had they treated the
Americans on the ship badly.</p>

<p>After the greetings were over the story of how
the radio messages were sent was told in full.
The radio man aboard the <i>Redbird</i> was a German
sympathizer. He usually slept through the afternoon
watch, however, and it was then the girls
had been able to get regularly at the instrument.
The rest of the crew thought Lilian was only
playing with the radio. She told them she could
receive a little, but she sent in so clumsy a way
that the Germans paid little attention to her.</p>

<p>“And, of course, I never was a Morse expert,”
the girl said, laughing. “You used to make fun
of me, George, when we had the radio plant at
home; but I guess I could be an operator, if I
put my mind to it, as well as you.”</p>

<p>“You’re all right, Lil,” declared her brother.
Then with a grin, he added: “I know Phil thinks
you are. He can’t keep his eyes off you.”</p>

<p>There was a great deal to say, of course; but
there was more to do. The boys were left aboard
while Mr. MacMasters returned to the <i>Colodia</i>
with Captain Lawdor of the <i>Redbird</i>, who had
been locked into his cabin by the mutineers. He
wished to confer with Commander Lang regarding
the make-up of a crew to work his ship into
some port. She could not go all the way to Bahia
with only the handful of men who had remained
faithful.</p>

<p>This was overcome very easily, however. The
captured raider was repaired and was sent north
with a prize crew. Then the commander of the
destroyer sent help aboard the <i>Redbird</i> and agreed
to convoy the sailing ship into a safe zone.</p>

<p>Farther south the Brazilian warships were
patroling the coast of South America, and they
would accompany the big sailing vessel into Bahia.
For, of course, Mr. Belding had no intention of
changing his plans, having already come so far
from New York.</p>

<p>The girls were too courageous to lose spirit.
Phoebe, who had been so ill when last her brother
had seen her, was getting plump again. She had
marvelously improved during the brief weeks of
her sojourn at sea.</p>

<p>Altogether, both Philip Morgan and George
Belding had become quite happy and content when
the <i>Colodia</i> finally signaled the <i>Redbird</i> good-bye
and turned her prow north once more. She had
been ordered to follow the captured raider into
Hampton Roads, there to refit.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, as America’s activities in the war&mdash;especially
her naval activities&mdash;were increasing
rather than diminishing, the Navy Boys did not
expect to be idle, even if the <i>Colodia</i> was laid up
for a while.</p>

<p>“No rest for the wicked,” quoted Al Torrance,
wagging his head.</p>

<p>“Oi, oi!” cried Ikey. “You know you are not
looking for a rest, Torry.”</p>

<p>“Seems to me,” Belding said, “that it will be
rather nice to walk on the streets once more.”</p>

<p>“Bet we’ll all be land-sick when we get ashore,”
grinned Frenchy Donahue. “How ’bout it,
Whistler?”</p>

<p>Whistler said, thoughtfully: “But wouldn’t it
be nice if we could have had our leave ashore at
Bahia, with the girls?”</p>

<p>“Wow, wow!” shouted the Irish lad.</p>

<p>“He’s hopeless,” groaned Ikey Rosenmeyer.
“He is even worse than Frenchy ever was. Why,
he can’t keep his mind off those girls at all!”</p>

<p>But the older lad only grinned. It was small
matter to Whistler Morgan whether they tried to
worry him or not. Lilian Belding was certainly
a pretty girl!</p>

12mo, cloth, illustrated and with colored jacket</div>
<p class='fs09'>Two chums join the air service in this country
and then go to France and enter the Lafayette
Escadrille. After doing their duty to our sister
republic they re-enter the American service and
are put to the most severe tests as airmen. They
manage to locate a long-range German cannon
which is doing terrific damage, and are present at
the bombing of the last Hun stronghold. A series
by one who knows all about army aviation.</p>

<div class='tac mb10'>12mo, cloth, colored jacket and illustrated</div>
<p class='fs09'>Vance Barnum is a real treasure when it
comes to telling about how magicians do their
weird tricks, how the circus acrobats pull off
their various stunts, how the “fishman” remains
under water so long, how the mid-air
performers loop the loop and how the slack-wire
fellow keeps from tumbling. He has been
through it all and he writes freely for the boys
from his vast experience. They are real stories
bound to hold their audiences breathlessly.</p>
